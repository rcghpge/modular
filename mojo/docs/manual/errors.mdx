title: Errors, error handling, and context managers
sidebar_label: Errors and context managers
---

This page discusses how to raise errors in Mojo programs and how to detect and
handle error conditions. It also discusses how you can use context managers to
correctly allocate and release resources such as files, even when error
conditions occur. Finally, it shows you how to implement context managers for
your own custom resources.

## Raise an error

The `raise` statement raises an error condition in your program. You provide the
`raise` statement with an [`Error`](/mojo/stdlib/builtin/error/Error) instance
to indicate the type of error that occurred. For example:

```mojo
raise Error("integer overflow")
```

As a convenience, you can instead provide an error message in the form of a
[`String`](/mojo/stdlib/collections/string/string/String) or
[`StringLiteral`](/mojo/stdlib/builtin/string_literal/StringLiteral) value, and
`raise` automatically uses that to create an `Error` instance. So you can raise
the same error condition as shown above by executing:

```mojo
raise "integer overflow"
```

:::note

Currently, Mojo does not support typed error conditions. All errors are
instances of `Error`, and the only thing that distinguishes different error
conditions is the error message that you provide.

:::

An error interrupts the execution flow of your program. If you provide an error
handler (as described in [Handle an error](#handle-an-error)) in the current
function, execution resumes with that handler. If the error isn't handled in the
current function, it propagates to the calling function and so on. If an error
isn't caught by any error handler, your program terminates with a non-zero exit
code and prints a stack trace, if enabled, followed by the error message. For
example:

```output
stack trace was not collected. Enable stack trace collection with environment variable `MOJO_ENABLE_STACK_TRACE_ON_ERROR`
Unhandled exception caught during execution: integer overflow
```

## Enable stack trace generation for errors

By default, Mojo generates a stack trace when your program hits a segmentation
fault. If you don't want this behavior, you can disable it by setting the
`MOJO_ENABLE_STACK_TRACE_ON_CRASH` environment variable to `0` or `false`
(case-insensitive).

However, Mojo *doesn't* generate a stack trace when your program raises an
errorâ€”we skip this to avoid the additional run-time overhead. If you want stack
traces for raised errors, you can enable them by setting the
`MOJO_ENABLE_STACK_TRACE_ON_ERROR` environment variable to any value other than
`0` or `false` (case-insensitive).

Keep in mind that when you compile your program with [`mojo
build`](/mojo/cli/build/), the compiler optimizes and strips symbols by default,
so often your stack trace won't be very useful.

Let's look at this program:

```mojo title="stacktrace_error.mojo"
def func2() -> None:
    raise Error("Intentional error")


def func1() -> None:
    func2()


def main():
    func1()
```

If you compile the program with the default settings and run it with the
environment variable set, you'll see a stack trace without symbols:

```sh
mojo build stacktrace_error.mojo
```
```sh
MOJO_ENABLE_STACK_TRACE_ON_ERROR=1 stacktrace_error
```

```output
#0 0x0000000104ef8ecc llvm::sys::PrintStackTrace(llvm::raw_ostream&, int) (/Users/ken/tmp/stack/.pixi/envs/default/lib/libKGENCompilerRTShared.dylib+0xccecc)

#2 0x000000010478868c main (/Users/ken/tmp/stack/stacktrace_error+0x10000068c)

Unhandled exception caught during execution: Intentional error
```

To generate a more useful stack trace, you need to compile the program with
`--debug-level full` (or `-g`) to include debug symbols:

```sh
mojo build --debug-level full stacktrace_error.mojo
```
```sh
MOJO_ENABLE_STACK_TRACE_ON_ERROR=1 ./stacktrace_error
```

```output

Unhandled exception caught during execution: Intentional error
```

:::note

At this time, running your program directly with [`mojo run`](/mojo/cli/run) or
`mojo` doesn't include debug symbols in the stack trace even with `--debug-level
full`. For example:

```sh
MOJO_ENABLE_STACK_TRACE_ON_ERROR=1 mojo --debug-level full stacktrace_error.mojo
```

```output

Unhandled exception caught during execution: Intentional error
mojo: error: execution exited with a non-zero result: 1
```

:::

As described in [Handle an error](#handle-an-error), you can bind the `Error`
instance to a variable in the `except` clause. If you do, you can invoke its
[`get_stack_trace()`](/mojo/stdlib/builtin/error/Error#get_stack_trace) method
to get a [`StackTrace`](/mojo/stdlib/builtin/error/StackTrace) instance.
`StackTrace` implements the [`Stringable`](/mojo/stdlib/builtin/str/Stringable)
trait, so you can construct a `String` with `String(stack_trace)` if you want to
extract the stack trace as a `String` for further processing. For example:

```mojo
def func2() -> None:
    raise Error("Intentional error")


def func1() -> None:
    func2()


def main():
    try:
        func1()
    except e:
        print(e)
        print("-" * 20)
        print(String(e.get_stack_trace()))
```

When you compile this program with symbols and run it with stack trace
generation enabled, you'll see the following output:

```sh
mojo build --debug-level full stacktrace_error_capture.mojo
```
```sh
MOJO_ENABLE_STACK_TRACE_ON_ERROR=1 ./stacktrace_error_capture
```

```output

```

Without enabling stack trace generation, the output is:

```output
Intentional error
--------------------
stack trace was not collected. Enable stack trace collection with environment variable `MOJO_ENABLE_STACK_TRACE_ON_ERROR`
```

## Declare a raising function

A function defined using the `fn` keyword is *non-raising* by default. So if it
can raise an error, you must include the `raises` keyword in the function
definition. For example:

```mojo
fn incr(n: Int) raises -> Int:
    if n == Int.MAX:
        raise "inc: integer overflow"
    else:
        return n + 1
```

If you don't include the `raises` keyword on an `fn` function,
then the function must explicitly handle any errors that might occur in the code
it executes. For example:

```mojo
# This function doesn't compile because of the unhandled error
fn unhandled_error(n: Int):
    print(n, "+ 1 =", incr(n))

# This function compiles because it handles the possible error
fn handled_error(n: Int):
    try:
        print(n, "+ 1 =", incr(n))
    except e:
        print("Handled an error:", e)
```

In contrast, a `def` function is *raising* by default. So the following
`incr()` function is equivalent to the `incr()` function defined above with
`fn`:

```mojo
def incr(n: Int) -> Int:
    if n == Int.MAX:
        raise "inc: integer overflow"
    else:
        return n + 1
```

## Handle an error

Mojo allows you to detect and handle error conditions using the `try-except`
control flow structure. The full syntax is:

```mojo
try:
    # Code block to execute that might raise an error
except <optional_variable_name>:
    # Code block to execute if an error occurs
else:
    # Code block to execute if no error occurs
finally:
    # Final code block to execute in all circumstances
```

You must include one or both of the `except` and `finally` clauses. The `else`
clause is optional.

The `try` clause contains a code block to execute that might raise an error. If
no error occurs, the entire code block executes. If an error occurs, execution
of the code block stops at the point that the error is raised. Your program then
continues with the execution of the `except` clause, if provided, or the
`finally` clause.

If the `except` clause is present, its code block executes only if an error
occurred in the `try` clause. The `except` clause "consumes" the error that
occurred in the `try` clause. You can then implement any error handling or
recovery that's appropriate for your application.

If you provide the name of a variable after the `except` keyword, then the
`Error` instance is bound to the variable if an error occurs. The `Error` type
implements the [`Writable`](/mojo/stdlib/utils/write/Writable) trait, so you can
pass it as an argument to the [`print()`](/mojo/stdlib/builtin/io/print)
function if you'd like to print its error message to the console. It also
implements the [`Stringable`](/mojo/stdlib/builtin/str/Stringable) trait, so you
can construct a `String` with `String(error)` if you want to extract the error
message as a `String` for further processing.

If desired, you can re-raise an error condition from your `except` clause simply
by executing a `raise` statement from within its code block. This can be either
a new `Error` instance or, if you provided a variable name to capture the
`Error` that occurred originally, you can re-raise that error.

:::note

Because Mojo does not currently support typed errors, a `try-except` control
structure can include at most one `except` clause, which catches any `Error`
raised.

:::

If the `else` clause is present, its code block executes only if an error does
not occur in the `try` clause. Note that the `else` clause is *skipped* if the
`try` clause executes a `continue`, `break`, or `return` that exits from the
`try` block.

If the `finally` clause is present, its code block executes after the `try`
clause and the `except` or `else` clause, if applicable. The `finally` clause
executes even if one of the other code blocks exits by executing a `continue`,
`break`, or `return` statement or by raising an error. The `finally` clause is
often used to release resources used by the `try` clause (such as a file handle)
regardless of whether an error occurred.

As an example, consider the following program:

```mojo title="handle_error.mojo"
def incr(n: Int) -> Int:
    if n == Int.MAX:
        raise "inc: integer overflow"
    else:
        return n + 1

def main():
    for value in [0, 1, Int.MAX]:
        try:
            print()
            print("try     =>", value)
            if value == 1:
                continue
            result = "{} incremented is {}".format(value, incr(value))
        except e:
            print("except  =>", e)
        else:
            print("else    =>", result)
        finally:
            print("finally => ====================")
```

Running this program generates the following output:

```output
try     => 0
else    => 0 incremented is 1
finally => ====================

try     => 1
finally => ====================

try     => 9223372036854775807
except  => inc: integer overflow
finally => ====================
```

## Use a context manager

A *context manager* is an object that manages resources such as files, network
connections, and database connections. It provides a way to allocate resources
and release them automatically when they are no longer needed, ensuring proper
cleanup and preventing resource leaks even in the case of error conditions.

As an example, consider reading data from a file. A naive approach might look
like this:

```mojo
# Obtain a file handle to read from storage
f = open(input_file, "r")
content = f.read()
# Process the content as needed
# Close the file handle
f.close()
```

Calling [`close()`](/mojo/stdlib/builtin/file/FileHandle#close) releases the
memory and other operating system resources associated with the opened file. If
your program were to open many files without closing them, you could exhaust the
resources available to your program and cause errors. The problem is even worse
if you were writing to a file instead of reading from it, because the operating
system might buffer the output in memory until the file is closed. If your
program were to crash instead of exiting normally, that buffered data could be
lost instead of being written to storage.

The example above actually includes the call to `close()`, but it ignores the
possibility that [`read()`](/mojo/stdlib/builtin/file/FileHandle#read) could
raise an error, which would prevent the `close()` from executing.
To handle this scenario, you could rewrite the code to use `try` like this:

```mojo
# Obtain a file handle to read from storage
f = open(input_file, "r")

try:
    content = f.read()
    # Process the content as needed
finally:
    # Ensure that the file handle is closed even if read() raises an error
    f.close()
```

However, the [`FileHandle`](/mojo/stdlib/builtin/file/FileHandle) struct
returned by [`open()`](/mojo/stdlib/builtin/file/open) is a context manager.
When used with Mojo's `with` statement, a context manager ensures that the
resources it manages are properly released at the end of the block, even if an
error occurs. In the case of a `FileHandle`, that means the call to `close()`
takes place automatically. So you could rewrite the example above to take
advantage of the context manager (and omit the explicit call to `close()`)
like this:

```mojo
with open(input_file, "r") as f:
    content = f.read()
    # Process the content as needed
```

The `with` statement also allows you to use multiple context managers within the
same code block. As an example, the following code opens one text file, reads
its entire content, converts it to upper case, and then writes the result to a
different file:

```mojo
with open(input_file, "r") as f_in, open(output_file, "w") as f_out:
    input_text = f_in.read()
    output_text = input_text.upper()
    f_out.write(output_text)
```

`FileHandle` is perhaps the most commonly used context manager. Other examples
of context managers in the Mojo standard library are
[`NamedTemporaryFile`](/mojo/stdlib/tempfile/tempfile/NamedTemporaryFile),
[`TemporaryDirectory`](/mojo/stdlib/tempfile/tempfile/TemporaryDirectory),
[`BlockingScopedLock`](/mojo/stdlib/utils/lock/BlockingScopedLock), and
[`assert_raises`](/mojo/stdlib/testing/testing/assert_raises). You can also
create your own custom context managers, as described in [Write a custom context
manager](#write-a-custom-context-manager) below.

## Write a custom context manager

Writing a custom context manager is a matter of defining a
[struct](/mojo/manual/structs) that implements two special *dunder* methods
("double underscore" methods): `__enter__()` and `__exit__()`:

- `__enter__()` is called by the `with` statement to enter the runtime context.
  The `__enter__()` method should initialize any state necessary for the context
  and return the context manager.

- `__exit__()` is called when the `with` code block completes execution, even if
  the `with` code block terminates with a call to `continue`, `break`, or
  `return`. The `__exit__()` method should release any resources associated with
  the context. After the `__exit__()` method returns, the context manager is
  destroyed.

  If the `with` code block raises an error, then the `__exit__()` method runs
  before any error processing occurs (that is, before it is caught by a
  `try-except` structure or your program terminates). If you'd like to define
  conditional processing for error conditions in a `with` code block, you can
  implement an overloaded version of `__exit__()` that takes an `Error`
  argument. For more information, see [Define a conditional `__exit__()`
  method](#define-a-conditional-__exit__-method) below.

  For context managers that don't need to release resources or perform other
  actions on termination, you are not required to implement an `__exit__()`
  method. In that case the context manager is destroyed automatically after the
  `with` code block completes execution.

Here is an example of implementing a `Timer` context manager, which prints the
amount of time spent executing the `with` code block:

```mojo title="context_mgr.mojo"
import sys
import time

@fieldwise_init
struct Timer(ImplicitlyCopyable, Movable):
    var start_time: Int

    fn __init__(out self):
        self.start_time = 0

    fn __enter__(mut self) -> Self:
        self.start_time = Int(time.perf_counter_ns())
        return self

    fn __exit__(mut self):
        end_time = time.perf_counter_ns()
        elapsed_time_ms = round(((end_time - self.start_time) / 1e6), 3)
        print("Elapsed time:", elapsed_time_ms, "milliseconds")

def main():
    with Timer():
        print("Beginning execution")
        time.sleep(1.0)
        if len(sys.argv()) > 1:
            raise "simulated error"
        time.sleep(1.0)
        print("Ending execution")
```

Running this example produces output like this:

```sh
mojo context_mgr.mojo
```

```output
Beginning execution
Ending execution
Elapsed time: 2010.0 milliseconds
```

```sh
mojo context_mgr.mojo fail
```

```output
Beginning execution
Elapsed time: 1002.0 milliseconds
Unhandled exception caught during execution: simulated error
```

### Define a conditional `__exit__()` method

When creating a context manager, you can implement the `__exit__(self)` form of
the `__exit__()` method to handle completion of the `with` statement under all
circumstances including errors. However, you have the option of additionally
implementing an overloaded version that is invoked instead when an error occurs
in the `with` code block:

```mojo
fn __exit__(self, error: Error) raises -> Bool
```

Given the `Error` that occurred as an argument, the method can do any of the
following actions:

- Return `True` to suppress the error
- Return `False` to re-raise the error
- Raise a new error

The following is an example of a context manager that suppresses only a certain
type of error condition and propagates all others:

```mojo title="conditional_context_mgr.mojo"
import time

@fieldwise_init
struct ConditionalTimer(ImplicitlyCopyable, Movable):
    var start_time: Int

    fn __init__(out self):
        self.start_time = 0

    fn __enter__(mut self) -> Self:
        self.start_time = Int(time.perf_counter_ns())
        return self

    fn __exit__(mut self):
        end_time = time.perf_counter_ns()
        elapsed_time_ms = round(((end_time - self.start_time) / 1e6), 3)
        print("Elapsed time:", elapsed_time_ms, "milliseconds")

    fn __exit__(mut self, e: Error) raises -> Bool:
        if String(e) == "just a warning":
            print("Suppressing error:", e)
            self.__exit__()
            return True
        else:
            print("Propagating error")
            self.__exit__()
            return False

def flaky_identity(n: Int) -> Int:
    if (n % 4) == 0:
        raise "really bad"
    elif (n % 2) == 0:
        raise "just a warning"
    else:
        return n

def main():
    for i in range(1, 9):
        with ConditionalTimer():
            print("\nBeginning execution")

            print("i =", i)
            time.sleep(0.1)

            if i == 3:
                print("continue executed")
                continue

            j = flaky_identity(i)
            print("j =", j)

            print("Ending execution")
```

Running this example produces this output:

```output
Beginning execution
i = 1
j = 1
Ending execution
Elapsed time: 105.0 milliseconds

Beginning execution
i = 2
Suppressing error: just a warning
Elapsed time: 106.0 milliseconds

Beginning execution
i = 3
continue executed
Elapsed time: 106.0 milliseconds

Beginning execution
i = 4
Propagating error
Elapsed time: 106.0 milliseconds
Unhandled exception caught during execution: really bad
```
