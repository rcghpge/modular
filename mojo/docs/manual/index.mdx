Welcome to the Mojo Manual, your complete guide to the MojoðŸ”¥ programming language!

Combined with the [Mojo API reference](/mojo/lib), this documentation provides
everything you need to write high-performance Mojo code for CPUs and GPUs. If
you see anything that can be improved, please [file an
issue](https://github.com/modular/modular/issues/new?assignees=&labels=documentation%2Cmodular-repo%2Cmojo&projects=&template=doc_issue.yaml&title=%5BDocs%5D)
or send a pull request for the [docs on
GitHub](https://github.com/modular/modular/tree/main/mojo/docs).

## What is Mojo

Mojo is a systems programming language specifically designed for
high-performance AI infrastructure and heterogeneous hardware. Its Pythonic
syntax makes it easy for Python programmers to learn and it fully integrates
the existing Python ecosystem, including its wealth of AI and machine-learning
libraries.

It's the first programming language built from the ground-up using MLIRâ€”a
modern compiler infrastructure for heterogeneous hardware, from CPUs to GPUs
and other AI ASICs. That means you can use one language to write all your code,
from high-level AI applications all the way down to low-level GPU kernels,
without using any hardware-specific libraries (such as CUDA and ROCm).

Learn more about it in the [Mojo vision](/mojo/vision) doc.

## Key features

- **Python syntax & interop**: Mojo adopts (and extends) Python's syntax and
integrates with existing Python code. Mojo's interoperability works in both
directions, so you can import Python libraries into Mojo and create Mojo
bindings to call from Python. [Read about Python
interop](/mojo/manual/python/).

- **Struct-based types**: All data typesâ€”including basic types such as `String`
and `Int`â€”are defined as structs. No types are built into the language itself.
That means you can define your own types that have all the the same
capabilities as the standard library types. [Read about
structs](/mojo/manual/structs).

- **Zero-cost traits**: Mojo's trait system solves the problem of static typing
by letting you define a shared set of behaviors that types (structs) can
implement. It allows you to write functions that depend on traits rather than
specific types, similar to interfaces in Java or protocols in Swift, except
with compile-time type checking and no run-time performance cost. [Read about
traits](/mojo/manual/traits).

- **Value ownership**: Mojo's ownership system ensures that only one variable
"owns" a specific value at a given timeâ€”such that Mojo can safely deallocate
the value when the owner's lifetime endsâ€”while still allowing you to share
references to the value. This provides safety from errors such as
use-after-free, double-free, and memory leaks without the overhead cost of a
garbage collector. [Read about ownership](/mojo/manual/values).

- **Compile-time metaprogramming**: Mojo's parameterization system enables
powerful metaprogramming in which the compiler generates a unique version of a
type or function based on parameter values, similar to C++ templates, but more
intuitive.
[Read about parameterization](/mojo/manual/parameters/).

- **Hardware portability**: Mojo is designed from the ground up to support
heterogeneous hardwareâ€”the Mojo compiler makes no assumptions about whether
your code is written for CPUs, GPUs, or something else. Instead, hardware
behaviors are handled by Mojo libraries, as demonstrated by types such as
`SIMD` that allows you to write vectorized code for CPUs, and the `gpu`
package that enables hardware-agnostic GPU programming. [Read about GPU
programming](/mojo/manual/gpu/fundamentals).
