You can add the `@fieldwise_init` decorator on a struct to generate the
field-wise `__init__()` constructor.

For example, consider a simple struct like this:

```mojo
@fieldwise_init
struct MyPet:
    var name: String
    var age: Int
```

Mojo sees the `@fieldwise_init` decorator and synthesizes a field-wise
constructor, the result being as if you had actually written this:

```mojo
struct MyPet:
    var name: String
    var age: Int

    fn __init__(out self, var name: String, age: Int):
        self.name = name^
        self.age = age
```

You can also synthesize the copy constructor and move constructor by adding the
`Copyable` and `Movable` traits to your struct. For more information about these
lifecycle methods, read [Life of a value](/mojo/manual/lifecycle/life).
