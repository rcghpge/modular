title: '@align'
description: Specifies a minimum alignment for a struct.
codeTitle: true

Add the `@align(N)` decorator on a struct to specify the minimum alignment in
bytes. The value `N` must be a positive power of 2.

For example, adding `@align(64)` on a struct containing an `Int` (8-byte
aligned) aligns the struct to 64 bytes:

```mojo
from sys import align_of

@align(64)
struct CacheAligned:
    var data: Int

fn main():
    print(align_of[CacheAligned]())  # Prints 64
```

The actual alignment will be `max(N, natural_alignment)`, because you cannot
reduce alignment below the struct's natural alignment. For example, `@align(1)`
on a struct containing an `Int` (8-byte aligned) will emit a warning and the
struct will remain 8-byte aligned.

Both stack and heap allocations respect `@align`.

## Parametric alignment

The alignment value can also be a struct parameter, enabling generic aligned
types:

```mojo
from sys import align_of

@align(Self.alignment)
struct AlignedBuffer[alignment: Int]:
    var data: Int

fn main():
    print(align_of[AlignedBuffer[64]]())   # Prints 64
    print(align_of[AlignedBuffer[128]]())  # Prints 128
```

The alignment is validated when the struct is instantiated, so invalid values
like `AlignedBuffer[3]` will produce a compile-time error.
