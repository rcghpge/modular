title: Traits
description: Define shared behavior for types.
---

A *trait* is a set of requirements that a type must implement. You can think of
it as a contract: a type that *conforms* to a trait guarantees that it
implements all of the features of the trait.

Traits are similar to Java *interfaces*, C++ *concepts*, Swift *protocols*, and
Rust *traits*. If you're familiar with any of those features, Mojo traits solve
the same basic problem.

## Background

In dynamically-typed languages like Python, you don't need to explicitly declare
that two classes are similar. This is easiest to show by example:

```python title="🐍 Python"
class Duck:
    def quack(self):
        print("Quack.")

class StealthCow:
    def quack(self):
        print("Moo!")

def make_it_quack(maybe_a_duck):
    try:
        maybe_a_duck.quack()
    except:
        print("Not a duck.")

make_it_quack(Duck())
make_it_quack(StealthCow())
```

The `Duck` and `StealthCow` classes aren't related in any way, but they both
define a `quack()` method, so they work the same in the `make_it_quack()`
function. This works because Python uses dynamic dispatch—it identifies the
methods to call at runtime. So `make_it_quack()` doesn't care what types
you're passing it, only the fact that they implement the `quack()` method.

In a statically-typed environment, this approach doesn't work:
Mojo functions require you to
specify the type of each argument. If you wanted to write this example in Mojo
*without* traits, you'd need to write a function overload for each input type.

```mojo title="🔥 Mojo"
@value
struct Duck:
    fn quack(self):
        print("Quack")

@value
struct StealthCow:
    fn quack(self):
        print("Moo!")

fn make_it_quack(definitely_a_duck: Duck):
    definitely_a_duck.quack()

fn make_it_quack(not_a_duck: StealthCow):
    not_a_duck.quack()

make_it_quack(Duck())
make_it_quack(StealthCow())
```

```output
Quack
Moo!
```

This isn't too bad with only two types. But the more types you want to
support, the less practical this approach is.

You might notice that the Mojo versions of `make_it_quack()` don't include the
`try/except` statement. We don't need it because Mojo's static type checking
ensures that you can only pass instances of `Duck` or `StealthCow` into the
`make_it_quack()`function.

## Using traits

Traits solve this problem by letting you define a shared set of *behaviors* that
types can implement. Then you can write a function that depends on the trait,
rather than individual types. As an example, let's update the `make_it_quack()`
example using traits. The first step is defining a trait:

```mojo
trait Quackable:
    fn quack(self):
        ...
```

A trait looks a lot like a struct, except it's introduced by the `trait`
keyword. A trait can contain method signatures, but it can't implement those
methods. Each method signature must be followed by
three dots (`...`) to indicate that the method is unimplemented.

A trait can also include associated aliases—compile-time constant values that
must be defined by conforming structs. Associated aliases are useful for writing
traits that describe generic types. For more information, see
[Associated aliases for generics](#associated-aliases-for-generics).

:::note TODO

In the future, we plan to support defining fields and default method
implementations inside a trait.

:::

Next we create some structs that conform to the `Quackable` trait. To indicate
that a struct conforms to a trait, include the trait name in parenthesis after
the struct name. You can also include multiple traits, separated by commas.
(If you're familiar with Python, this looks just like Python's inheritance
syntax.)

```mojo
@value
struct Duck(Quackable):
    fn quack(self):
        print("Quack")

@value
struct StealthCow(Quackable):
    fn quack(self):
        print("Moo!")
```

The struct needs to implement any methods that are declared in the trait. The
compiler enforces conformance: if a struct says it conforms to a trait, it must
implement everything required by the trait or the code won't compile.

Finally, you can define a function that takes a `Quackable` like this:

```mojo
fn make_it_quack[type: Quackable](maybe_a_duck: type):
    maybe_a_duck.quack()
```

This syntax may look a little unfamiliar if you haven't dealt with Mojo
[parameters](/mojo/manual/parameters/) before. What this signature
means is that `maybe_a_duck` is an argument of type `type`, where `type` is a
type that must conform to the `Quackable` trait.

Using the method is simple enough:

```mojo
make_it_quack(Duck())
make_it_quack(StealthCow())
```

```output
Quack
Moo!
```

Note that you don't need the square brackets when you call `make_it_quack()`:
the compiler infers the type of the argument, and ensures the type has the
required trait.

One limitation of traits is that you can't add traits to existing types. For
example, if you define a new `Numeric` trait, you can't add it to the standard
library `Float64` and `Int` types. However, the standard library already
includes quite a few traits, and we'll be adding more over time.

### Traits can require static methods

In addition to regular instance methods, traits can specify required static
methods.

```mojo
trait HasStaticMethod:
    @staticmethod
    fn do_stuff(): ...

fn fun_with_traits[type: HasStaticMethod]():
    type.do_stuff()
```

## Trait compositions

You can compose traits using the `&` sigil. This lets you define new traits
that are simple combinations of other traits. You can use a trait composition
anywhere that you'd use a single trait:

```mojo
trait Flyable:
    fn fly(self): ...

fn quack_and_go[type: Quackable & Flyable](quacker: type):
    quacker.quack()
    quacker.fly()

@value
struct FlyingDuck(Quackable & Flyable):
    fn quack(self):
        print("quack")

    fn fly(self):
        print("whoosh!")

quack_and_go(FlyingDuck())
```

You can also use the `alias` keyword to create a shorthand name for a
trait composition:

```mojo
alias DuckLike = Quackable & Flyable

struct ToyDuck(DuckLike):
    # ... implementation omitted
```

Previously, you could only compose traits using
[inheritance](#trait-inheritance), by defining a new, empty trait like this:

```mojo
trait DuckTrait(Quackable, Flyable):
    pass
```

The difference is that using the `trait` keyword defines a new, named
trait. For a struct to *explicitly* conform to this trait, you need to include
it in the struct's signature. On the other hand, the `DuckLike` alias represents
a composition of two separate traits, `Quackable` and `Flyable`, and anything
that conforms to those two traits conforms to `DuckLike`. For example, our
earlier `FlyingDuck` type:

```mojo
struct FlyingDuck(Quackable & Flyable):
    # ... etc
```

Because `FlyingDuck` conforms to both `Quackable` and `Flyable`, it also
conforms to the `DuckLike` trait composition. But it *doesn't* explicitly
conform to `DuckTrait`, since it doesn't include `DuckTrait` in its list of
traits.

Currently this distinction doesn't make much difference, because Mojo supports
[implicit trait conformance](#implicit-trait-conformance), which means that
`FlyingDuck` is treated as if it conforms to `DuckTrait`, since it meets all of
the requirements. However, implicit conformance is due to be phased out in the
future, so we recommend replacing empty traits like `DuckTrait` with more
flexible trait compositions.

## Trait inheritance

Traits can inherit from other traits. A trait that inherits from another trait
includes all of the requirements declared by the parent trait. For example:

```mojo
trait Animal:
    fn make_sound(self):
        ...

# Bird inherits from Animal
trait Bird(Animal):
    fn fly(self):
        ...
```

Since `Bird` inherits from `Animal`, a struct that conforms to the `Bird` trait
needs to implement **both** `make_sound()` and `fly()`. And since every `Bird`
conforms to `Animal`, a struct that conforms to `Bird` can be passed to any
function that requires an `Animal`.

To inherit from multiple traits, add a comma-separated list of traits or
trait compositions inside the parenthesis. For example, you could define a
`NamedAnimal` trait that combines the requirements of the `Animal` trait and a
new `Named` trait:

```mojo
trait Named:
    fn get_name(self) -> String:
        ...

trait NamedAnimal(Animal & Named):
    # ...
```

Inheritance is useful when you're creating a new trait that adds its own
requirements. If you simply want to express the union of two or more traits,
you can use a simple trait composition instead:

```mojo
alias NamedAnimal = Animal & Named
```

## Traits and lifecycle methods

Traits can specify required
[lifecycle methods](/mojo/manual/lifecycle/#lifecycles-and-lifetimes), including
constructors, copy constructors and move constructors.

For example, the following code creates a `MassProducible` trait. A
`MassProducible` type has a default (no-argument) constructor and can be moved.
It uses the built-in [`Movable`](/mojo/stdlib/builtin/value/Movable) trait,
which requires the type to have a [move
constructor](/mojo/manual/lifecycle/life#move-constructor).

The `factory[]()` function returns a newly-constructed instance of a
`MassProducible` type.

```mojo
trait DefaultConstructible:
    fn __init__(out self): ...

alias MassProducible = DefaultConstructible & Movable

fn factory[type: MassProducible]() -> type:
    return type()

struct Thing(MassProducible):
    var id: Int

    fn __init__(out self):
        self.id = 0

    fn __moveinit__(out self, owned existing: Self):
        self.id = existing.id

var thing = factory[Thing]()
```

Note that [`@register_passable("trivial")`](/mojo/manual/decorators/register-passable#register_passabletrivial)
types have restrictions on their lifecycle methods: they can't define copy or
move constructors, because they don't require any custom logic.

For the purpose of trait conformance, the compiler treats trivial types as
copyable and movable.

## Implicit trait conformance

Mojo currently supports *implicit* trait conformance, but this will be
deprecated in a future release.

Implicit conformance means that if a type implements
all of the methods required for a trait, it's treated as conforming to the
trait, even if it doesn't explicitly include the trait in its declaration:

```mojo
struct RubberDucky:
    fn quack(self):
        print("Squeak!")

make_it_quack(RubberDucky())
```

Implicit conformance can be convenient, but supporting it prevents us from
adding future trait features like default function implementations.

We strongly recommend using explicit trait conformance for all new code and
phasing out dependence on implicit trait conformance.

## Built-in traits

The Mojo standard library includes many traits. They're implemented
by a number of standard library types, and you can also implement these on your
own types. These standard library traits include:

* [`Absable`](/mojo/stdlib/builtin/math/Absable)
* [`AnyType`](/mojo/stdlib/builtin/anytype/AnyType)
* [`Boolable`](/mojo/stdlib/builtin/bool/Boolable)
* [`Comparable`](/mojo/stdlib/builtin/comparable/Comparable)
* [`Copyable`](/mojo/stdlib/builtin/value/Copyable)
* [`Defaultable`](/mojo/stdlib/builtin/value/Defaultable)
* [`Hashable`](/mojo/stdlib/hashlib/hash/Hashable)
* [`Indexer`](/mojo/stdlib/builtin/int/Indexer)
* [`Intable`](/mojo/stdlib/builtin/int/Intable)
* [`IntableRaising`](/mojo/stdlib/builtin/int/IntableRaising)
* [`KeyElement`](/mojo/stdlib/collections/dict/#keyelement)
* [`Movable`](/mojo/stdlib/builtin/value/Movable)
* [`PathLike`](/mojo/stdlib/os/pathlike/PathLike)
* [`Powable`](/mojo/stdlib/builtin/math/Powable)
* [`Representable`](/mojo/stdlib/builtin/repr/Representable)
* [`Sized`](/mojo/stdlib/builtin/len/Sized)
* [`Stringable`](/mojo/stdlib/builtin/str/Stringable)
* [`StringableRaising`](/mojo/stdlib/builtin/str/StringableRaising)
* [`Roundable`](/mojo/stdlib/builtin/math/Roundable)
* [`Writable`](/mojo/stdlib/utils/write/Writable)
* [`Writer`](/mojo/stdlib/utils/write/Writer)

The API reference docs linked above include usage examples for each trait. The
following sections discuss a few of these traits.

### The `Sized` trait

The [`Sized`](/mojo/stdlib/builtin/len/Sized) trait identifies types that
have a measurable length, like strings and arrays.

Specifically, `Sized` requires a type to implement the `__len__()` method.
This trait is used by the built-in [`len()`](/mojo/stdlib/builtin/len/len)
function. For example, if you're writing a custom list type, you could
implement this trait so your type works with `len()`:

```mojo
struct MyList(Sized):
    var size: Int
    # ...

    fn __init__(out self):
        self.size = 0

    fn __len__(self) -> Int:
        return self.size

print(len(MyList()))
```

```output
0
```

### The `Intable` and `IntableRaising` traits

The [`Intable`](/mojo/stdlib/builtin/int/Intable) trait identifies a type that
can be implicitly converted to `Int`. The
[`IntableRaising`](/mojo/stdlib/builtin/int/IntableRaising) trait describes a
type can be converted to an `Int`, but the conversion might raise an error.

Both of these traits require the type to implement the `__int__()` method. For
example:

```mojo
@value
struct Foo(Intable):
    var i: Int

    fn __int__(self) -> Int:
        return self.i

var foo = Foo(42)
print(Int(foo) == 42)
```

```output
True
```

### The `Stringable`, `Representable`, and `Writable` traits

The [`Stringable`](/mojo/stdlib/builtin/str/Stringable) trait identifies a type
that can be explicitly converted to
[`String`](/mojo/stdlib/collections/string/string/String). The
[`StringableRaising`](/mojo/stdlib/builtin/str/StringableRaising) trait
describes a type that can be converted to a `String`, but the conversion might
raise an error. These traits also mean that the type can support both the `{!s}`
and `{}` format specifiers of the `String` and `StringSlice` class's
[`format()`](/mojo/stdlib/collections/string/string/String#format) method. These
traits require the type to define the
[`__str__()`](/mojo/stdlib/builtin/str/Stringable#__str__) method.

In contrast, the [`Representable`](/mojo/stdlib/builtin/repr/Representable)
trait defines a type that can be used with the built-in
[`repr()`](/mojo/stdlib/builtin/repr/repr) function, as well as the `{!r}`
format specifier of the `format()` method. This trait requires the type to
define the [`__repr__()`](/mojo/stdlib/builtin/repr/Representable#__repr__)
method, which should compute the "official" string representation of a type. If
at all possible, this should look like a valid Mojo expression that could be
used to recreate a struct instance with the same value.

The [`Writable`](/mojo/stdlib/utils/write/Writable) trait describes a
type that can be converted to a stream of UTF-8 encoded data by writing to a
`Writer` object. The [`print()`](/mojo/stdlib/builtin/io/print) function
requires that its arguments conform to the `Writable` trait. This enables
efficient stream-based writing by default, avoiding unnecessary intermediate
String heap allocations.

The `Writable` trait requires a type to implement a
[`write_to()`](/mojo/stdlib/utils/write/Writable#write_to) method, which
is provided with an object that conforms to the
[`Writer`](/mojo/stdlib/utils/write/Writer) as an argument. You then
invoke the `Writer` instance's
[`write()`](/mojo/stdlib/utils/write/Writer#write) method to write a
sequence of `Writable` arguments constituting the `String` representation of
your type.

While this might sound complex at first, in practice you can minimize
boilerplate and duplicated code by using the
[`String.write()`](/mojo/stdlib/collections/string/string/String#write) static
function to implement the type's `Stringable` implementation in terms of its
`Writable` implementation. Here is a simple example of a type that implements
all of the `Stringable`, `Representable`, and `Writable` traits:

```mojo
@value
struct Dog(Stringable, Representable, Writable):
    var name: String
    var age: Int

    # Allows the type to be written into any `Writer`
    fn write_to[W: Writer](self, mut writer: W) -> None:
        writer.write("Dog(", self.name, ", ", self.age, ")")

    # Construct and return a `String` using the previous method
    fn __str__(self) -> String:
        return String.write(self)

    # Alternative full representation when calling `repr`
    fn __repr__(self) -> String:
        return String("Dog(name=", repr(self.name), ", age=", repr(self.age), ")")

var dog = Dog("Rex", 5)
print(repr(dog))
print(dog)

var dog_info = "String: {!s}\nRepresentation: {!r}".format(dog, dog)
print(dog_info)
```

```output
Dog(name='Rex', age=5)
Dog(Rex, 5)
String: Dog(Rex, 5)
Representation: Dog(name='Rex', age=5)
```

### The `AnyType` trait

When building a generic container type, one challenge is knowing how to dispose
of the contained items when the container is destroyed. Any type that
dynamically allocates memory needs to supply a
[destructor](/mojo/manual/lifecycle/death#destructor) (`__del__()` method)
that must be called to free the allocated memory. But not all types have a
destructor, and your Mojo code has no way to determine which is which.

The [`AnyType`](/mojo/stdlib/builtin/anytype/AnyType) trait solves this
issue: every trait implicitly inherits from `AnyType`, and all structs conform
to `AnyType`, which guarantees that the type has a destructor. For types that
don't have one, Mojo adds a no-op destructor. This means you can call the
destructor on any type.

This makes it possible to build generic collections without leaking memory. When
the collection's destructor is called, it can safely call the destructors on
every item it contains.

## Generic structs with traits

You can also use traits when defining a generic container. A generic container
is a container (for example, an array or hashmap) that can hold different data
types. In a dynamic language like Python it's easy to add  different types of
items to a container. But in a statically-typed environment the compiler needs
to be able to identify the types at compile time. For example, if the container
needs to copy a value, the compiler needs to verify that the type can be copied.

The [`List`](/mojo/stdlib/collections/list) type is an example of a
generic container. A single `List` can only hold a single type of data.
For example, you can create a list of integer values like this:

```mojo
var list = List[Int](1, 2, 3)  # or: var list = [1, 2, 3]
for i in range(len(list)):
    print(list[i], sep=" ", end="")
```

```output
1  2  3
```

You can use traits to define requirements for elements that are stored in a
container. For example, `List` requires elements that can be moved and
copied. To store a struct in a `List`, the struct needs to conform to
the `Copyable` and `Movable` traits, which require a
[copy constructor](/mojo/manual/lifecycle/life#copy-constructor) and a
[move constructor](/mojo/manual/lifecycle/life#move-constructor).

Building generic containers is an advanced topic. For an introduction, see the
section on
[parameterized structs](/mojo/manual/parameters/#parameterized-structs).

### Associated aliases for generics

In addition to methods, a trait can include _associated aliases_, which must be
defined by any conforming struct. For example:

```mojo
trait Repeater:
    alias count: Int
```

An implementing struct must define a concrete constant value for the alias,
using any compile-time parameter value. For example, it can use a literal
constant or a compile-time expression, including one that uses the struct's
parameters.

```mojo
struct Doublespeak(Repeater):
    alias count: Int = 2

struct Multispeak[verbosity: Int](Repeater):
    alias count: Int = verbosity*2+1
```

The `Doublespeak` struct has a constant value for the alias, but the `Multispeak`
struct lets the user set the value using a parameter:

```mojo
repeater = Multispeak[12]()
```

Note that the alias is named `count`, and the `Multispeak` parameter is named
`verbosity`. Parameters and aliases are in the same namespace, so the parameter
can't have the same name as the associated alias.

Associated aliases are most useful for writing traits for generic types. For
example, imagine that you want to write a trait that describes a generic stack
data structure that stores elements that conform to the `Copyable` and `Movable`
traits.

By adding the element type as an associated alias to the trait, you can specify
generic methods on the trait:

```mojo
trait Stacklike:
    alias EltType: Copyable & Movable

    fn push(mut self, var item: Self.EltType):
        pass

    fn pop(mut self) -> Self.EltType:
        pass
```

The following struct implements the `Stacklike` trait using a `List` as the
underlying storage:

```mojo
struct MyStack[type: Copyable & Movable](Stacklike):
    """A simple Stack built using a List."""
    alias EltType = type
    alias list_type = List[Self.EltType]

    var list: Self.list_type

    fn __init__(out self):
        self.list = Self.list_type()

    fn push(mut self, var item: Self.EltType):
        self.list.append(item)

    fn pop(mut self) -> Self.EltType:
        return self.list.pop()

    fn dump[WritableEltType: Writable & Copyable & Movable](self: MyStack[WritableEltType]):
        for item in self.list:
            print(item)
```

The `MyStack` type adds a `dump()` method that prints the contents of the stack.
Because a struct that conforms to `Copyable` and `Movable` is not necessarily
printable, `MyStack` uses
[conditional conformance](/mojo/manual/parameters/#conditional-conformance) to
define a `dump()` method that works as long as the element type is
[writable](/mojo/stdlib/utils/write/Writable/).

The following code exercises this new trait by defining a generic method,
`add_to_stack()` that adds an item to any `Stacklike` type.

```mojo
def add_to_stack[S: Stacklike](mut stack: S, item: S.EltType):
    stack.push(item)

def main():
    s = MyStack[Int]()
    add_to_stack(s, 12)
    add_to_stack(s, 33)
    s.dump()             # [12, 33]
    print(s.pop())       # 33
```
