description: Using layouts to describe multidimensional data.
---

Mojo’s [`layout` package](/mojo/kernels/layout/) provides a number of APIs for
working with dense multidimensional arrays, which simplify writing algorithms
for handling linear algebra.

This package includes the following main types:

- The [`Layout`](/mojo/kernels/layout/layout/Layout) struct describes an
  arrangement of data in memory. A *layout* is a function that maps a set of
  logical coordinates (like (*x*, *y*) in a two-dimensional array) to a linear
  index value. Layouts can be hierarchical (for example, representing a 2D
  matrix that’s further subdivided into tiles).
- [`LayoutTensor`](/mojo/kernels/layout/layout_tensor/LayoutTensor) is a flexible
  tensor type that combines a `Layout` and a pointer to data.
- The [`IntTuple`](/mojo/kernels/layout/int_tuple/IntTuple) struct is a
  hierarchical tuple type, where each element of the tuple can either be an
  integral value or a nested `IntTuple`. The `IntTuple` type is used extensively
  for defining and indexing layouts and layout tensors.

:::tip Example code

You can find most of the code examples on this page in the [public GitHub repo](https://github.com/modular/modular/tree/main/examples/mojo/layouts).

Some of the concepts presented here can be a little hard to grasp from static
examples, so we recommend downloading the example code and experimenting.

:::

## What’s a Layout?

A layout is a function that maps a set of logical coordinates to a single linear
index value.

For example, a layout could describe a 2x4 row-major matrix, or a 6x6
column-major matrix.

```mojo
from layout import Layout, print_layout

var l2x4row_major = Layout.row_major(2, 4)
var l6x6col_major = Layout.col_major(6, 6)
```

Layouts are made up of two tuples: shape and stride, where shape describes the
logical coordinate space and the stride determines the mapping to the linear
index value. A layout can be written as (*shape*:*stride*). For
example, a contiguous vector of length 4 can be represented as (4:1):

<figure>

![](../images/layout/1d-layout-with-strides.png#light)
![](../images/layout/1d-layout-with-strides-dark.png#dark)

<figcaption><b>Figure 1.</b> 1D layout (4:1)</figcaption>
</figure>

A 3x4 row-major layout can be represented as ((3, 4):(4, 1)). That is, the
*shape* is 3x4 and the *strides* are 4 and 1. You can break this down into two
sub-layouts or *modes*: a row mode and a column mode: 3 rows with a stride of 4
(3:4, the first numbers from each tuple) and 4 columns with a stride of 1 (4:1,
the second numbers from each tuple).

The [`print_layout()`](/mojo/kernels/layout/layout/print_layout) function
generates an ASCII diagram of any 2D layout, showing the coordinates on the
outside and the corresponding index values in the grid.

```mojo
var l3x4row_major = Layout.row_major(3, 4)
print_layout(l3x4row_major)
```

Output:

```plaintext
((3, 4):(4, 1))
       0    1    2    3
    +----+----+----+----+
 0  |  0 |  1 |  2 |  3 |
    +----+----+----+----+
 1  |  4 |  5 |  6 |  7 |
    +----+----+----+----+
 2  |  8 |  9 | 10 | 11 |
    +----+----+----+----+
```

The coordinate to index mapping is performed by calculating the dot product of
the logical coordinates and the corresponding strides. For example, given the
coordinates (*i, j*) and the layout shown above, the index value is $i*4 + j*1$.
So coordinate (1, 1) maps to 5, as shown in the diagram.

The following example shows how to use a `Layout` to convert between coordinates
and index values.

```mojo
var coords = IntTuple(1, 1)
var idx = l3x4row_major(coords)
print("index at coordinates (1, 1): ", idx)
print("coordinates at index 7:", l3x4row_major.idx2crd(7))
```

Output:

```plaintext
index at coordinates (1, 1):  5
coordinates at index 7: (1, 3)
```

As this example shows, the layout is a function that takes a set of integer
coordinates and returns a single integer (the linear index). The `Layout` struct
also provides an [`idx2crd()`](/mojo/kernels/layout/layout/Layout#idx2crd) method
that transforms a linear index into a set of logical coordinates.

:::note Printing layouts

You can use `print_layout()` to print a diagram of any 2D layout. You can pass
*any* layout to the built-in `print()` function to print a string representation
of the layout in the form of a (*shape*:*stride*) pair.

:::

### IntTuple: representing hierarchical shapes and strides

A layout’s shape and stride are represented using the
[`IntTuple`](/mojo/kernels/layout/int_tuple/IntTuple) type. Each element of an
`IntTuple` is either an integer value or a nested `IntTuple`. You can create
nested `IntTuples` using the `IntTuple` constructor:

```mojo
var shape1 = IntTuple(4, IntTuple(2, 2))
```

A layout’s shape and stride tuples must be *congruent*—that is, they need to
have the same hierarchical structure: the tuples must have the same number of
elements, and any elements that are nested tuples must also have the same number
of elements.

The [`int_tuple`](/mojo/kernels/layout/int_tuple/) package provides a number of
functions for working with `IntTuple`. For example, it provides a
[`congruent()`](/mojo/kernels/layout/int_tuple/congruent) function for testing
the congruency of two tuples.

### Modes

A layout has one or more *modes*, where a mode is a shape:stride pair. For
example, the 1D vector layout (8:1) has a single mode: 8 elements with a stride
of 1:

<figure>

![](../images/layout/1d-layout.png#light)
![](../images/layout/1d-layout-dark.png#dark)

<figcaption><b>Figure 2.</b> 1D layout</figcaption>
</figure>

The 2D row-major matrix layout ((2, 4):(4, 1)) has two modes, 2:4 (the first
numbers from each tuple) and 4:1 (the second numbers from each tuple). Taking
them right to left, the second mode describes 4 columns with a stride of one.
The first mode specifies that there are two of these groups with a stride of 4:

<figure>

![](../images/layout/2d-layout-with-strides.png#light)
![](../images/layout/2d-layout-with-strides-dark.png#dark)

<figcaption><b>Figure 3.</b> 2D layout with strides</figcaption>
</figure>

In a column-major layout, the row number varies the fastest, so a column-major
2x4 matrix has the layout ((2, 4):(1, 2)) and looks like this:

<figure>

![](../images/layout/2d-col-major-layout-with-strides.png#light)
![](../images/layout/2d-col-major-layout-with-strides-dark.png#dark)

<figcaption><b>Figure 4.</b> 2D column-major layout with strides</figcaption>
</figure>

A layout’s *rank* is the number of modes in its shape. A rank-1 (or 1D) layout
describes a vector. A rank-2 layout describes a 2D matrix, and so on.

A layout’s *size* is defined as the product of all of the modes in the layout’s
shape. To put it another way, it’s the number of elements that the layout
addresses: that is, the *domain* of the layout function.

Modes can also be nested to represent more complicated strides along a
dimension. For example, the layout (8:1) represents a 1D vector of 8 elements.

<figure>

![](../images/layout/1d-layout.png#light)
![](../images/layout/1d-layout-dark.png#dark)

<figcaption><b>Figure 5.</b> 1D vector layout</figcaption>
</figure>

The layout (((4, 2):(1, 4))) is *also* a 1D vector of 8 elements. The extra set
of parentheses indicates a nested or hierarchical mode. Instead of being
represented by a single mode like 8:1, this layout’s single dimension is
represented by the multi-mode (4, 2):(1, 4):

<figure>

![](../images/layout/1d-multi-modal-layout.png#light)
![](../images/layout/1d-multi-modal-layout-dark.png#dark)

<figcaption><b>Figure 6.</b> 1D layout with nested modes</figcaption>
</figure>

Note that in the nested modes, there’s no notion of row and column. You can
think of the first mode as the “inner” mode (defining a group) and the next mode
as an “outer” mode (defining a repeat of the group) as shown above.

A set of nested modes (a *multi-mode*) counts as a single mode when considering
the parent layout’s rank. For example, the layouts (8:1) and (((4, 2):(1, 4)))
are both rank-1 layouts.

This gets more interesting when we move to two dimensions. Consider the
following 2D layouts:

<figure>

![](../images/layout/multi-modal-layout.png#light)
![](../images/layout/multi-modal-layout-dark.png#dark)

<figcaption><b>Figure 7.</b> Two 2D layouts</figcaption>
</figure>

Layouts A and B are both 2D matrix layouts with the same overall 2D shape, but
with the elements in a different order. Layout B is *tiled*, so instead of being
in row-major or column-major order, four consecutive indices are grouped into
each 2x2 tile. This is sometimes called *tile-major order*.

We can break this tiled layout into two modes, one for the rows and one for the columns:

- Layout B has a row mode of (2, 2):(1, 4). We can further break this into two
  sub-modes: the inner mode, 2:1, defines a group of two rows with a stride of
  one. The outer mode, 2:4, specifies that the group occurs twice with a stride
  of 4.
- The column has the mode (2, 2):(2, 8). Once again we can break this into two
  sub-modes: (2:2) defines a group of two columns with a stride of two, and the
  group occurs twice with a stride of 8 (2:8).

 If all of those modes are swimming before your eyes, take a moment to study the
 figure and trace out the strides yourself.

### Coordinates

Coordinates for layouts can be written in the same format as the shape tuple.
For example, coordinates for layout B above can be written ((*i, j*), (*k, l*)).
However, this layout can also be addressed as a logical 2D matrix, just like
layout A. So ((0, 1), (0, 1)) and (2, 2) are both valid coordinates that map to
the same index.

In fact, this is true for any layout: the layout can be addressed with 1D or 2D
coordinates as well as its “natural” coordinates. When mapping coordinates, the
dimensions are traversed in *colexicographical* order (that is, a generalized
column-major order, where the leftmost coordinate varies fastest). Table 1 shows
how different 1D and 2D coordinates map to the “natural” coordinates of the ((2,
2), (2, 2)) shape shown above:

<figure>

| 1D | 2D | Natural |
| ----- | :---- | :---- |
| 0 | (0, 0) | ((0, 0), (0, 0)) |
| 1 | (1, 0) | ((1, 0), (0, 0)) |
| 2 | (2, 0) | ((0, 1), (0, 0)) |
| 3 | (3, 0) | ((1, 1), (0, 0)) |
| 4 | (0, 1) | ((0, 0), (1, 0)) |
| 5 | (1, 1) | ((1, 0), (1, 0)) |
| 6 | (2, 1) | ((0, 1), (1, 0)) |
| 7 | (3, 1) | ((1, 1), (1, 0)) |
| 8 | (0, 2) | ((0, 0), (0, 1)) |
| ... | ... | ... |
| 15 | (3, 3) | ((1, 1), (1, 1)) |

## Making layouts

There are multiple ways to create layouts. The
[`row_major()`](/mojo/kernels/layout/layout/Layout/#row_major) and
[`col_major()`](/mojo/kernels/layout/layout/Layout/#col_major) static methods are
probably the simplest ways to create a layout. The `row_major()` method creates
a generalized row-major layout: that is, the rightmost coordinate varies the
fastest. The `col_major()` method creates a generalized column-major layout,
where the leftmost coordinate varies the fastest.

```mojo
print(Layout.row_major(4, 4, 4))
print(Layout.col_major(4, 4, 4))
```

Output:

```plaintext
((4, 4, 4):(16, 4, 1))
((4, 4, 4):(1, 4, 16))
```

If you know the shape and strides in advance, you can construct an arbitrarily
complex layout using the `Layout` constructor. For example:

```mojo
var tiled_layout = Layout(
    IntTuple(IntTuple(3, 2), IntTuple(2, 5)), # shape
    IntTuple(IntTuple(1, 6), IntTuple(3, 12)) # strides
)
print_layout(tiled_layout)
```

Output:

```plaintext

(((3, 2), (2, 5)):((1, 6), (3, 12)))
       0    1    2    3    4    5    6    7    8    9
    +----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+
 0  |  0 |  3 | 12 | 15 | 24 | 27 | 36 | 39 | 48 | 51 |
    +----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+
 1  |  1 |  4 | 13 | 16 | 25 | 28 | 37 | 40 | 49 | 52 |
    +----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+
 2  |  2 |  5 | 14 | 17 | 26 | 29 | 38 | 41 | 50 | 53 |
    +----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+
 3  |  6 |  9 | 18 | 21 | 30 | 33 | 42 | 45 | 54 | 57 |
    +----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+
 4  |  7 | 10 | 19 | 22 | 31 | 34 | 43 | 46 | 55 | 58 |
    +----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+
 5  |  8 | 11 | 20 | 23 | 32 | 35 | 44 | 47 | 56 | 59 |
    +----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+
```

The result is a 6x10 tile-major layout. The layout is indexed vertically in 2
groups of 3 rows (3, 2) : (1, 6) ( and horizontally in 5 groups of 2 columns (2,
5):(3, 12). Alternatively, you can think of this as a layout consisting of 3x2
column-major tiles ((3, 2):(1, 3)) that are arranged into two rows of 5, ((2,
5):(6, 12)).

The `Layout` constructor works fine if you know the shape and strides in
advance, but calculating the strides for a complicated layout isn’t always
intuitive.

An easier way to generate this layout is the
[`tile_to_shape()`](/mojo/kernels/layout/layout/tile_to_shape) function.
This takes a layout (representing the tile) and a final shape to tile to:

```mojo
var tts = tile_to_shape(Layout.col_major(3, 2), IntTuple(6, 10))
print_layout(tts)
```

Output:

```plaintext
(((3, 2), (2, 5)):((1, 6), (3, 12)))
       0    1    2    3    4    5    6    7    8    9
    +----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+
 0  |  0 |  3 | 12 | 15 | 24 | 27 | 36 | 39 | 48 | 51 |
    +----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+
 1  |  1 |  4 | 13 | 16 | 25 | 28 | 37 | 40 | 49 | 52 |
    +----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+
 2  |  2 |  5 | 14 | 17 | 26 | 29 | 38 | 41 | 50 | 53 |
    +----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+
 3  |  6 |  9 | 18 | 21 | 30 | 33 | 42 | 45 | 54 | 57 |
    +----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+
 4  |  7 | 10 | 19 | 22 | 31 | 34 | 43 | 46 | 55 | 58 |
    +----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+
 5  |  8 | 11 | 20 | 23 | 32 | 35 | 44 | 47 | 56 | 59 |
    +----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+
```

A variation on `tile_to_shape()` is the
[`blocked_product()`](/mojo/kernels/layout/layout/blocked_product) function. The
main difference is that where `tile_to_shape()` takes an output *shape*,
`blocked_product()` takes a *tiler* layout: essentially, every element in the
tiler layout is replaced by a tile. The following example generates the same
tiled layout using `blocked_product()`. It also prints out the two input
layouts.

```mojo
# Define 2x3 tile
var tile = Layout.col_major(3, 2)
# Define a 2x5 tiler
var tiler = Layout.col_major(2, 5)
var blocked = blocked_product(tile, tiler)

print("Tile:")
print_layout(tile)
print("\nTiler:")
print_layout(tiler)
print("\nTiled layout:")
print(blocked)
```

Output:

```plaintext
Tile:
((3, 2):(1, 3))
      0   1
    +---+---+
 0  | 0 | 3 |
    +---+---+
 1  | 1 | 4 |
    +---+---+
 2  | 2 | 5 |
    +---+---+

Tiler:
((2, 5):(1, 2))
       0    1    2    3    4
    +----+----+----+----+----+
 0  |  0 |  2 |  4 |  6 |  8 |
    +----+----+----+----+----+
 1  |  1 |  3 |  5 |  7 |  9 |
    +----+----+----+----+----+

Tiled layout:
(((3, 2), (2, 5)):((1, 6), (3, 12)))

```

As you can see, `blocked_product()` combines two simple layouts to generate a
more complex one.

Finally, if you know the *shape* you want and the *order* in which you want to
iterate through the dimensions, you can use the
[`make_ordered_layout()`](/mojo/kernels/layout/layout/make_ordered_layout)
function. For example, the following example is yet one more way to generate the
previous tiled layout:

```mojo
var ordered = make_ordered_layout(
    IntTuple(IntTuple(3, 2), IntTuple(2, 5)), # shape
    IntTuple(IntTuple(0, 2), IntTuple(1, 3))  # order
)
print(ordered)
```

Output:

```plaintext
(((3, 2), (2, 5)):((1, 6), (3, 12)))
```

The generated layout's strides follow the same ordering as `order`—that is, the
dimension with the smallest corresponding `order` value has the smallest stride
value, and so on. The strides are computed such that the layout is dense—that
is, the logical multidimensional array is contiguous.

## Non-contiguous layouts

All of the examples so far have been dense layouts, where all of the elements
are contiguous in memory. However, layouts can also describe sparse logical
arrays. For example, a (4:2) layout is a sparse 1D array:

<figure>

![](../images/layout/1d-sparse-layout.png#light)
![](../images/layout/1d-sparse-layout-dark.png#dark)

<figcaption><b>Figure 8.</b> 1D sparse layout (4:2)</figcaption>
</figure>

A layout’s *cosize* is the size of the layout’s codomain, which you can think of
as the size of the smallest contiguous array that can contain all of the
layout’s elements. The cosize is the largest linear index value generated by the
layout plus 1. So in the example in Figure 8, the layout has a size of 4, but a
cosize of 7.
