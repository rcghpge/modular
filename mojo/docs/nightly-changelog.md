This version is still a work in progress.

## Language enhancements

## Language changes

## Library changes

- `Int` is now an alias for `Scalar[DType.int]` and integer literals materialize
  to this `Scalar` type. Because of this some conversions have become more
  strict.

  A new `SIMDSize` type has been added for the width of `SIMD` itself and must
  be used when inferring a parameter based on a SIMD argument like so:

  ```mojo
  def frob[w: SIMDSize](v: SIMD[DType.int, w]): ...
  ```

  Alternitively the width can be unbound if you simply want to be parametric
  over any `SIMD` type:

  ```mojo
  def frob(v: SIMD[DType.int, _])
  ```

  The new `Int` should still be used in all other situations.

- `ImplicitlyDestructible` has been renamed to `ImplicitlyDeletable`, for better
  name consistency with its required `__del__()` "delete" special method.

- The implicit conversion constructors that cast an `UnsafePointer` to
  `MutUnsafeAnyOrigin` or `ImmutUnsafeAnyOrigin` are now deprecated and emit a
  deprecation warning when used. `UnsafeAnyOrigin` is an unsafe escape hatch
  that silently extends unrelated lifetimes and disables exclusivity checking,
  so it should never be applied implicitly. Prefer keeping a concrete origin;
  if you must discard it, make the cast explicit with the
  `as_unsafe_any_origin()` method.

## Tooling changes

- Added a `--lld-path` CLI flag. This overrides the LLD path that Mojo uses.

## GPU programming

- Added `warp.match_any()`, which returns, for each warp lane, the mask of
  lanes whose value has the same bits. It uses NVIDIA's `match.any.sync`
  instruction, a `readfirstlane` ballot fold on AMD, and a shuffle-based
  emulation on Apple Silicon GPUs.

- Added `warp.match_all()`, which returns the warp's active-lane mask if every
  lane holds the same bits and 0 otherwise. It uses NVIDIA's `match.all.sync`
  instruction, a `readfirstlane` ballot fold on AMD, and a shuffle-based check
  on Apple Silicon GPUs.
