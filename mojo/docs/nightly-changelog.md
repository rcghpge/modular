# Nightly: v0.26.3

This version is still a work in progress.

## ✨ Highlights

## Documentation

## Language enhancements

- String literals now support `\uXXXX` and `\UXXXXXXXX` unicode escape
  sequences, matching Python. The resulting code point is stored as UTF-8.
  Invalid code points and surrogates are rejected at parse time.

## Language changes

- Mojo now warns on uses of the legacy `fn` keyword. Please move to `def` as
  this will upgrade to an error in the future.

## Library changes

- Standard library types now use conditional conformances, replacing previous
  `_constrained_conforms_to` checks:
  - `Span`: `Writable`

- Added `IterableOwned` trait to the iteration module. Types conforming to
  `IterableOwned` implement `__iter__(var self)`, which consumes the collection
  and returns an iterator that owns the underlying elements.
  - `List` now conforms to `IterableOwned`.

- `CStringSlice` can no longer represent a null pointer. To represent nullability
  use `Optional[CStringSlice]` which is guaranteed to have the same size and layout
  as `const char*`, where `NULL` is the empty `Optional`.

- `external_call`'s `return_type`'s requirements has been relaxed from
  `TrivialRegisterPassable` to `RegisterPassable`.

- `alloc[T](count, alignment)` will now `abort` if the underlying allocation failed.

## Tooling changes

## ❌ Removed

## 🛠️ Fixed

- Fixed `atof` producing incorrect results for floats near the
  normal/subnormal boundary (e.g., `Float64("4.4501363245856945e-308")`
  returned half the correct value).
