# Nightly: v0.26.3

This version is still a work in progress.

## ✨ Highlights

## Language enhancements

- Added `abi("C")` as a function effect for declaring C calling convention on
  function definitions and function pointer types. Functions marked with
  `abi("C")` use the platform C ABI (System V x86-64 / ARM64 AAPCS) for
  struct arguments and return values, enabling safe interop with C libraries:

  ```mojo
  # C-ABI function definition (safe as a callback into C code)
  def add(a: Int32, b: Int32) abi("C") -> Int32:
      return a + b

  # C-ABI function pointer type (safe for use with DLHandle.get_function)
  var f = handle.get_function[def(Float64) abi("C") -> Float64]("sqrt")
  ```

  `DLHandle.get_function[]` now enforces that the type parameter carries
  `abi("C")`, preventing silent ABI mismatches when loading C symbols.

- String literals now support `\uXXXX` and `\UXXXXXXXX` unicode escape
  sequences, matching Python. The resulting code point is stored as UTF-8.
  Invalid code points and surrogates are rejected at parse time.

- Added support for conditional `RegisterPassable` conformance.

- Variadic lists and packs can be forwarded through runtime calls with `*pack`
  when the callee takes a compatible variadic list/pack.

  ```mojo
  def callee[*Ts: Writable](*args: *Ts):
      comptime for i in range(args.__len__()):
          print(args[i])

  def forwarder[*Ts: Writable](*args: *Ts):
      callee(*args)

  forwarder(1, "hello", 3.14)  # prints each value on a separate line
  ```

## Language changes

- Variadic parameters value lists are now passed instead of `ParameterList`
  instead of `!kgen.param_list`. This makes it much more ergonomic to work with
  these types, e.g. simple logic just works:

  ```mojo
  def callee[*values: Int]():
      var v = 0
      for i in range(len(values)):
          v += values[i]
      for elt in values:
          v += elt
  ```

  Similarly, the `ParameterList` struct has other methods for transforming the
  value list, which are directly accessible on `values`. One caveat so far is
  that parameter variadics of types are still using the old representation.

- All Mojo functions now has a unique "function literal type". In practice, it
  means that:

  ```mojo
  # type_of(foo) != type_of(bar)

  def foo(): pass
  def bar(): pass
  ```

- Mojo now warns on uses of the legacy `fn` keyword. Please move to `def` as
  this will upgrade to an error in the future.

- Import statements of the form `from pkg import ...` no longer make `pkg`
  available to the module.

## Library changes

- `assert_raises` now catches custom `Writable` error types, not just `Error`.

- Variadics of types have been moved to the `TypeList` struct.
  One can write operations such as:

  ```mojo
  comptime assert TypeList[Trait=AnyType, Int, String]().contains[Bool]
  ```

- `abort(message)` now includes the call site location in its output. The
  location is automatically captured and printed alongside the message. You can
  also pass an explicit `SourceLocation` to override it:

  ```mojo
  abort("something went wrong")
  # prints: ABORT: path/to/file.mojo:42:5: something went wrong

  var loc = current_location()
  abort("something went wrong", location=loc)
  ```

- `abort(message)` now prints its message on Nvidia and AMDGPU, including
  block and thread IDs. Previously, the message was silently suppressed on
  these GPUs. On Apple GPU, the message is silently suppressed for now.

- `SourceLocation` fields (`line`, `col`, `file_name`) are now private.
  Use the new accessor methods `line()`, `column()`, and `file_name()` instead.

- Fixed default alignment in `TileTensor.load()` and `TileTensor.store()` to
  use the caller-specified `width` parameter instead of `Self.element_size`.

- Added uninitialized memory read detection for float loads. When compiled
  with `-D MOJO_STDLIB_SIMD_UNINIT_CHECK=true`, every float load is checked
  against the debug allocator's poison patterns (0xFF host fill and canonical
  qNaN device fill). A match triggers `abort()` with a descriptive message.
  When disabled (the default), zero runtime overhead. For MAX pipelines, set
  `MODULAR_MAX_UNINITIALIZED_READ_CHECK=true` to enable both the debug
  allocator and the load-time checks automatically.

- Added `CompilationTarget.is_apple_m5()` to `std.sys` for detecting Apple M5
  targets at compile time. `is_apple_silicon()` now includes M5 in its check.

- Added Apple M5 MMA intrinsics (`apple_mma_load`, `apple_mma_store`,
  `_mma_apple`) in `std.gpu.compute.arch.mma_apple`, enabling hardware matrix
  multiply-accumulate on Apple GPU.

- Standard library types now use conditional conformances, replacing previous
  `_constrained_conforms_to` checks:
  - `Span`: `Writable`, `Hashable`
  - `Tuple`, `Optional`, `Variant`, and `UnsafeMaybeUninit`: `RegisterPassable`
  - `Variant`: `Copyable`, `ImplicitlyCopyable`

- `OwnedDLHandle.get_symbol()` now returns `Optional[UnsafePointer[...]]`
  instead of aborting when a symbol is not found. This allows callers to handle
  missing symbols gracefully.

- GPU primitive id accessors (e.g. `thread_idx`) have migrated from `UInt` to
  `Int`.

  This is part of a broader migration to standardize on the `Int` type for all
  sizes and offsets in Mojo.

  To provide a gradual migration path, explicitly typed aliases are
  available temporarily.

  | Base         | `UInt` Accessor   | `Int` Accessor    |
  |--------------|-------------------|-------------------|
  | `thread_idx` | `thread_idx_uint` | `thread_idx_int`  |
  | `thread_dim` | `thread_dim_uint` | `thread_dim_int`  |
  | `block_dim`  | `block_dim_uint`  | `block_dim_int`   |
  | `grid_dim`   | `grid_dim_uint`   | `grid_dim_int`    |
  | `global_idx` | `global_idx_uint` | `global_idx_int`  |
  | `lane_id`    | `lane_id_uint`    | `lane_id_int`     |
  | `warp_id`    | `warp_id_uint`    | `warp_id_int`     |

  Code can preserve its prior behavior by using a renaming import of the
  `thread_idx_uint` alias:

  ```diff
  - from std.gpu import thread_idx
  + from std.gpu import thread_idx_uint as thread_idx
  ```

  Note that `thread_idx_uint` and the other `_*uint` aliases will eventually
  be deprecated and removed as well.

  After a temporary deprecation acting as a "speed bump" in the 2026-03-29
  nightly release, `thread_idx` etc. have changed from `UInt` to `Int`.

  Code built with a version where `thread_idx` is still `UInt`, can proactively
  migrate to the eventual `Int` behavior using the `thread_idx_int` alias:

  ```diff
  - from std.gpu import thread_idx
  + from std.gpu import thread_idx_int as thread_idx

  # ... update file to reflect change from `UInt` to `Int` ...
  ```

- Added `IterableOwned` trait to the iteration module. Types conforming to
  `IterableOwned` implement `__iter__(var self)`, which consumes the collection
  and returns an iterator that owns the underlying elements.
  - `List` now conforms to `IterableOwned`.
  - `Optional` now conforms to `IterableOwned`.
  - `Deque` now conforms to `IterableOwned`.
  - `LinkedList` now conforms to `IterableOwned`.
  - `Dict` now conforms to `IterableOwned`.
  - `Set` now conforms to `IterableOwned`.
  - `Counter` now conforms to `IterableOwned`.
  - `InlineArray` now conforms to `IterableOwned`.
  - `Span` now conforms to `IterableOwned` (conditional on `T: Copyable`).
    The owned iterator yields copies of elements by value.
  - Iterator adaptors (`enumerate`, `zip`, `map`, `peekable`, `take_while`,
    `drop_while`, `product`, `cycle`, `count`, `repeat`) now conform to
    `IterableOwned`.
  - Added owned overloads of `enumerate()`, `zip()`, `map()`, `peekable()`,
    `take_while()`, `drop_while()`, `product()`, and `cycle()` that consume the
    input iterable.

- `CStringSlice` can no longer represent a null pointer. To represent
  nullability use `Optional[CStringSlice]` which is guaranteed to have the same
  size and layout as `const char*`, where `NULL` is the empty `Optional`.

- `external_call`'s `return_type`'s requirements has been relaxed from
  `TrivialRegisterPassable` to `RegisterPassable`.

- Negative indexing on all stdlib collections has been removed to enable cheap
  CPU bounds checks by default:
  - `List`
  - `Span`
  - `InlineArray`
  - `String`
  - `StringSlice`
  - `LinkedList`
  - `Deque`
  - `IntTuple`

  Using a negative `IntLiteral` for indexing will now trigger a compile-time
  error, for example:

  ```text
  /tmp/main.mojo:3:12: note: call expansion failed with parameter value(s): (..., ...)
          print(x[-1])
              ^
  constraint failed: negative indexing is not supported, use e.g. `x[len(x) - 1]` instead
  ```

  Update any `x[-1]` to `x[len(x) - 1]`, following the compiler errors to
  your call sites as above.

  This does not affect any MAX ops that support negative indexing.

- Bounds checking is now on by default for all collections on CPU, and will show
  you the call site in your code where you triggered the out of bounds access:

  ```mojo
  def main():
      var x = [1, 2, 3]
      print(x[3])
  ```

  ```text
  At: /tmp/main.mojo:3:12: Assert Error: index 3 is out of bounds, valid range is 0 to 2
  ```

  Bounds checking is still off by default for GPU to avoid performance
  penalties. To enable it for tests:

  ```bash
  mojo build -D ASSERT=all main.mojo
  ```

  To turn off all asserts, including CPU bounds checking:

  ```bash
  mojo build -D ASSERT=none main.mojo
  ```

- `alloc[T](count, alignment)` will now `abort` if the underlying allocation
  failed.

- Added `Variadic.contains_value` comptime alias to check whether a variadic
  sequence contains a specific value at compile time.

- `ArcPointer` now conditionally conforms to `Hashable` and `Equatable` when
  its inner type `T` does. Both `__eq__` and `__hash__` delegate to the managed
  value, matching C++ `shared_ptr` and Rust `Arc` semantics. This makes
  `ArcPointer` usable as a `Dict` key or `Set` element with value-based
  equality. Pointer identity is still available via the `is` operator.

- `Path` now conforms to `Comparable`, enabling lexicographic ordering and use
  with `sort()`.

- `range()` overloads that took differently-typed arguments or arguments that
  were `Intable`/`IntableRaising` but not `Indexer` have been removed. Callers
  should ensure they're passing consistent integral argument types when calling
  `range()`.

- `Consistency` now has a default constructor that selects `RELEASE` ordering on
  Apple GPU and `SEQUENTIAL` on all other targets. All `Atomic` methods and
  `fence` use this platform-aware default instead of hard-coding `SEQUENTIAL`.

- `NDBuffer` has been fully removed. Please migrate to `TileTensor`.

- Added a generic `__contains__` method to `Span` for any element type
  conforming to `Equatable`, not just `Scalar` types.

- Fixed `blocked_product` in `tile_layout` to zip block and tiler dimensions
  per mode, matching the legacy `blocked_product` behavior.

- Added `Span`-based overloads for `enqueue_copy`, `enqueue_copy_from`, and
  `enqueue_copy_to` on `DeviceContext`, `DeviceBuffer`, and `HostBuffer`,
  providing a safer alternative to raw `UnsafePointer` for host-device memory
  transfers.

- `String.__len__()` has been deprecated. Prefer to use `String.byte_length()`
  or `String.count_codepoints()`.

## Tooling changes

- The Mojo debugger now displays scalar types (e.g. `UInt8`, `Float32`) as
  plain values instead of `([0] = value)`, and elides internal `_mlir_value`
  wrapper fields from struct display.

- `mojo format` no longer supports the deprecated `fn` keyword, nor the
  removed `owned` argument convention.

- Comptime function calls now print more nicely in error messages and generated
  documentation, not including `VariadicList`/`VariadicPack` and including
  keyword argument labels when required.

## GPU programming

- Added support for AMD MI250X accelerators.

## ❌ Removed

- The `escaping` function effect is no longer supported. Migrate
  `def(...) escaping -> T` closures to `unified` closures.

- The deprecated `@doc_private` decorator has been removed. Use `@doc_hidden`
  instead.

## 🛠️ Fixed

- Fixed `mojo format` crashing after upgrading Mojo versions due to a stale
  grammar cache. ([Issue #6144](https://github.com/modular/modular/issues/6144))

- Fixed `atof` producing incorrect results for floats near the
  normal/subnormal boundary (e.g., `Float64("4.4501363245856945e-308")`
  returned half the correct value).
  ([#6196](https://github.com/modular/modular/issues/6196))

- [Issue #5872](https://github.com/modular/modular/issues/5872): Fixed a
  compiler crash ("'get_type_name' requires a concrete type") when using
  default `Writable`, `Equatable`, or `Hashable` implementations on structs
  with MLIR-type fields (e.g. `__mlir_type.index`). The compiler now correctly
  reports that the field does not implement the required trait.
