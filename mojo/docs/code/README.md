# Mojo documentation code examples

This directory includes code examples used in the Mojo Manual and related
documentation at [docs.modular.com/mojo](https://docs.modular.com/mojo).
Reference solutions for Mojo tutorials can be found in the
[`/examples/mojo`](../../examples/mojo) directory. The primary purpose of this
directory is to enable automated testing of code examples.

**Note:** Code examples in the API reference documentation for the Mojo Standard
Library and other Modular open source libraries are embedded in the source files
for those libraries and are not included here.

## Contributing

If you see something in the documentation or the code examples that is incorrect
or could be improved, we'd love to accept your contributions. At this time, code
from this directory is **not** automatically included in the corresponding
documentation file. If you contribute a change to a code example, please be sure
to make a corresponding change to the copy of the code in the related
documentation, as well as any explanatory text.

Be aware that we don't provide tools to generate a preview of the website,
because the Mojo docs are built along with other content that's not included in
this repo. As such, we recommend you preview your edits in an IDE that can
render Markdown and MDX files, such as VS Code, including the
[VS Code environment in GitHub](https://github.dev/modular/modular/blob/main/).

For more information about how to contribute, see the
[Contributor Guide](../../CONTRIBUTING.md).
