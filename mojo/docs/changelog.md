## UNRELEASED

### ✨ Highlights

### Language enhancements

Literals now have a default type. For example, you can now bind
[1,2,3] to T in a call to a function defined as
 fn zip[T: Iterable](impl:T) because it will default to the
 standard library's List type.

### Language changes

### Standard library changes

- Added `unsafe_get`, `unsafe_swap_elements` and `unsafe_subspan` to `Span`.

- The deprecated `DType.index` is now removed in favor of the `DType.int`.

### Tooling changes

### ❌ Removed

### 🛠️ Fixed
