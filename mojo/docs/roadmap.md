description: A summary of our Mojo plans, including upcoming features and things we need to fix.
---

This document captures the broad plan about how we plan to implement things in
Mojo, and some early thoughts about key design decisions. This is not a full
design spec for any of these features, but it can provide a "big picture" view
of what to expect over time. It is also an acknowledgement of major missing
components that we plan to add.

## Overall priorities

Mojo is still in early development and many language features will arrive in
the coming months. We are highly focused on building Mojo the right way (for
the long-term), so we want to fully build-out the core Mojo language features
before we work on other dependent features and enhancements.

Currently, that means we are focused on the core GPU programming features
that are essential to [Mojo's mission](/mojo/why-mojo), and as outlined in the
following sections of this roadmap.

In the near-term, we will **not** prioritize "general goodness" work such as:

- Adding syntactic sugar and short-hands for Python.
- Adding features from other languages that are missing from Python (such as
  public/private declarations).
- Tackling broad Python ecosystem challenges like packaging.

If you have encountered any bugs with current Mojo behavior, please
[submit an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/modular/modular/issues).

If you have ideas about how to improve the core Mojo features, we prefer that
you first look for similar topics or start a new conversation about it
on [Discord](https://discord.gg/modular).

We also consider Mojo to be a new member of the Python family, so if you
have suggestions to improve the experience with Python, we encourage
you to propose these "general goodness" enhancements through the formal [PEP
process](https://peps.python.org/pep-0001/).

We periodically post roadmap updates in the Modular forumâ€”see the
[Official announcements](https://forum.modular.com/c/modular/announcements/9)
category.

## Small independent features

There are a number of features that are missing that are important to round out
the language fully, but which don't depend strongly on other features.  These
include things like:

- Improved package management support.
- Many standard library features, including copy-on-write data structures.
- Support for "top level code" at file scope.
- Algebraic data types like `enum` in Swift/Rust, and pattern matching.
- Many standard library types need refinement, including `Optional[T]`.

## Ownership and lifetimes

The ownership system is largely implemented, but we are still fixing bugs and
improving the developer experience. The current support for ownership includes
features like:

- Capture declarations in closures.
- Lifetime checker: complain about invalid mutable references.
- Lifetime checker: enforce argument exclusivity for mutable references.
- Functions can return references to owned values.
- `ref` pattern supported for binding a reference to a local name.

## Traits support

Mojo has basic support for
[traits](/mojo/manual/traits). Traits allow you
to specify a set of requirements for types to implement. Types can implement
those requirements to *conform to* the trait. Traits allow you to write
generic functions and generic containers, which can work with any type that
conforms to a given trait, instead of being hard-coded to work with a specific
type.

Currently, the only kind of requirements supported by traits are required method
signatures. The trait can't provide a default implementation for its required
methods, so each conforming type must implement all of the required methods.

A number of [built-in traits](/mojo/manual/traits#built-in-traits) are
already implemented in the standard library.

We plan to expand traits support in future releases. Planned features include:

- Support for default implementations of required methods.

- Support for a feature like Swift's extensions, allowing you to add a trait to
  a preexisting type.

- Improve support for conditional conformance.

## Classes

Mojo still doesn't support classes, the primary thing Python programmers use
pervasively!  This isn't because we hate dynamism - quite the opposite.  It is
because we need to get the core language semantics nailed down before adding
them.  We expect to provide full support for all the dynamic features in Python
classes, and want the right framework to hang that off of.

When we get here, we will discuss what the right default is: for example, is
full Python hash-table dynamism the default? Or do we use a more efficient
model by default (e.g. vtable-based dispatch and explicitly declared stored
properties) and allow opt'ing into dynamism with a `@dynamic` decorator on the
class. More discussion is [in this proposal](https://github.com/modular/modular/blob/main/mojo/proposals/mojo-and-dynamism.md).

## C/C++ Interop

Integration to transparently import Clang C/C++ modules.  Mojo's type system
and C++'s are very compatible, so we should be able to have something pretty
nice here. Mojo can leverage Clang to transparently generate a foreign function
interface between C/C++ and Mojo, with the ability to directly import functions:

```mojo
from "math.h" import cos

print(cos(0))
```

For now, however, working with C/C++ modules requires the
[`sys.ffi`](/mojo/stdlib/sys/ffi/) package.

## Full MLIR decorator reflection

All decorators in Mojo have hard-coded behavior in the parser. In time, we will
move these decorators to being compile-time metaprograms that use MLIR
integration. This may depend on C++ interop for talking to MLIR. This completely
opens up the compiler to programmers. Static decorators are functions executed
at compile-time with the capability to inspect and modify the IR of functions
and types.

```mojo
fn value(t: TypeSpec):
    t.__copyinit__ = # synthesize dunder copyinit automatically

@value
struct TrivialType: pass

fn full_unroll(loop: mlir.Operation):
    # unrolling of structured loop

fn main():
    @full_unroll
    for i in range(10):
        print(i)
```

## Sharp Edges

The entire Modular kernel library is written in Mojo, and its development has
been prioritized based on the internal needs of those users. Given that Mojo is
still a young language, there are a litany of missing small features that many
Python and systems programmers may expect from their language, as well as
features that don't quite work the way we want to yet, and in ways that can be
surprising or unexpected. This section of the document describes a variety of
"sharp edges" in Mojo, and potentially how to work around them if needed. We
expect all of these to be resolved in time, but in the meantime, they are
documented here.

### No `lambda` syntax

Mojo does not yet support defining anonymous functions with the `lambda`
keyword.

### Parametric aliases

Mojo aliases can refer to parametric values but cannot themselves have
parameter lists. As of v0.6.0, you can create a parametric alias by aliasing
an unbound or partially-bound type. For example, the new `Scalar` type is
defined as:

```mojo
alias Scalar = SIMD[size=1]
```

This creates a parametric alias that you can use like this:

```mojo
var i = Scalar[DType.int8]
```

Parametric aliases with an explicit parameter list aren't yet supported:

```mojo
alias mul2[x: Int] = x * 2
# Error!
```

### `Exception` is actually called `Error`

In Python, programmers expect that exceptions all subclass the `Exception`
builtin class. The only available type for Mojo "exceptions" is `Error`:

```mojo
fn raise_an_error() raises:
    raise Error("I'm an error!")
```

The reason we call this type `Error` instead of `Exception` is because it's not
really an exception. It's not an exception, because raising an error does not
cause stack unwinding, but most importantly it does not have a stack trace. And
without polymorphism, the `Error` type is the only kind of error that can be
raised in Mojo right now.

### No Python-style generator functions

Mojo does not yet support Python-style generator functions (`yield` syntax).
These are "synchronous co-routines" -- functions with multiple suspend points.

### Support for `async` is incomplete

Although the Mojo compiler has support for the `async` keyword, with `async fn`
and `async def`, the implementation of async functions and the surrounding
standard library features is not complete.

### Scoping and mutability of statement variables

Python programmers understand that local variables are implicitly declared and
scoped at the function level. As the Mojo Manual explains, this is supported in
Mojo for
[implicitly-declared variables](/mojo/manual/variables#implicitly-declared-variables).
However, there are some nuances to Python's implicit declaration rules that Mojo
does not match 1-to-1.

For example, the scope of `for` loop iteration variables and caught exceptions
in `except` statements is limited to the next indentation block, for both `def`
and `fn` functions. Python programmers will expect the following program to
print "2":

```python
for i in range(3): pass
print(i)
```

However, Mojo will complain that `print(i)` is a use of an unknown declaration,
The induction variable's lifetime doesn't outlive the loop.

In addition, the loop induction variable is an immutable reference by default.
Consider the following Python code:

```python
    list = [1, 2, 3]
    for i in list:
        i += 1
        print(i)
    print(list[0])
```

In Python, `i` is a **copy** of the value from the list, so changing the
value of `i` doesn't alter the list.

Mojo produces an error for the line `i += 1` because `i` is an immutable
reference, not a copy.

Use a `var` pattern if you want a local copy like python, or a `ref` pattern if
you want to mutate the values inside a mutable collection.

```mojo
for var i in list:
    i += 1  # i is a copy; changing i doesn't update the list

for ref i in list:
    i += 1  # i is a mutable reference; changing i updates the list 
```

### Name scoping of nested function declarations

In Python, nested function declarations produce dynamic values. They are
essentially syntactic sugar for `bar = lambda ...`.

```python
def foo():
    def bar(): # creates a function bound to the dynamic value 'bar'
        pass
    bar() # indirect call
```

In Mojo, nested function declarations are static, so calls to them are direct
unless made otherwise.

```mojo
fn foo():
    fn bar(): # static function definition bound to 'bar'
        pass
    bar() # direct call
    var f = bar # materialize 'bar' as a dynamic value
    f() # indirect call
```

Currently, this means you cannot declare two nested functions with the same
name. For instance, the following example does not work in Mojo:

```mojo
def pick_func(cond: Bool) -> def() capturing:
    if cond:
        def bar(): return 42
    else:
        def bar(): return 3 # error: redeclaration of 'bar'
    return bar
```

The functions in each conditional must be explicitly materialized as dynamic
values.

```mojo
def pick_func(cond)  -> def() capturing:
    var result: def() capturing # Mojo function type
    if cond:
        def bar0(): return 42
        result = bar0
    else:
        def bar1(): return 3
        result = bar1
    return result
```

We hope to sort out these oddities with nested function naming as our model
of closures in Mojo develops further.

### Limited polymorphism

Mojo has implemented static polymorphism through traits, as noted above. We
plan to implement dynamic polymorphism through classes and MLIR reflection in
the future.

Python programmers are used to implementing special dunder methods on their
classes to interface with generic methods like `print()` and `len()`. For
instance, one expects that implementing `__repr__()` or `__str__()` on a class
will enable that class to be printed using `print()`.

```python
class One:
    def __init__(self): pass
    def __repr__(self): return '1'

print(One()) # prints '1'
```

Mojo currently supports similar functionality through the
[`Writable`](/mojo/stdlib/utils/write/Writable) trait, so that `print()` works
on all `Writable` types. We'll continue to add traits support to the standard
library to enable common use cases like this.

### The standard library has limited exceptions use

For historic and performance reasons, core standard library types typically do
not use exceptions. For instance, `List` will not raise an
out-of-bounds access (it will crash), and `Int` does not throw on divide by
zero. In other words, most standard library types are considered "unsafe".

```mojo
var l = List[Int](capacity=0)
print(l[1]) # could crash or print garbage values (undefined behavior)

print(1//0) # does not raise and could print anything (undefined behavior)
```

This is clearly unacceptable given the strong memory safety goals of Mojo. We
will circle back to this when more language features and language-level
optimizations are available.

### Nested functions cannot be recursive

Nested functions (any function that is not a top-level function) cannot be
recursive in any way. Nested functions are considered "parameters", and although
parameter values do not have to obey lexical order, their uses and definitions
cannot form a cycle. Current limitations in Mojo mean that nested functions,
which are considered parameter values, cannot be cyclic.

```mojo
fn try_recursion():
    fn bar(x: Int): # error: circular reference :<
        if x < 10:
            bar(x + 1)
```

### Only certain loaded MLIR dialects can be accessed

Although Mojo provides features to access the full power of MLIR, in reality
only a certain number of loaded MLIR dialects can be accessed in the Playground
at the moment.

The upstream dialects available in the Playground are the
[`index`](https://mlir.llvm.org/docs/Dialects/IndexOps/) dialect and the
[`LLVM`](https://mlir.llvm.org/docs/Dialects/LLVM/) dialect.
