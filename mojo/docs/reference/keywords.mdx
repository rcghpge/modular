Keywords are reserved identifiers with special meaning in the language. They
cannot be used as ordinary variable names unless escaped with backticks.

## Core language keywords

| Keyword | Category | Purpose | Example |
|---------|----------|---------|---------|
| `and` | Logical | Boolean AND operator | `if x > 0 and y > 0:` |
| `or` | Logical | Boolean OR operator | `if valid or debug:` |
| `not` | Logical | Boolean NOT operator | `if not found:` |
| `if` | Control flow | Conditional execution | `if condition:` |
| `elif` | Control flow | Additional condition in if statement | `elif other_condition:` |
| `else` | Control flow | Default branch in conditionals or loops | `else:` |
| `for` | Control flow | Iteration loop | `for item in items:` |
| `while` | Control flow | Conditional loop | `while count < 10:` |
| `break` | Control flow | Exit innermost loop | `break` |
| `continue` | Control flow | Skip to next loop iteration | `continue` |
| `return` | Control flow | Return from function | `return value` |
| `pass` | Control flow | No-op placeholder statement | `pass` |
| `raise` | Exception | Raise an exception | `raise ValueError("error")` |
| `try` | Exception | Begin exception handling block | `try:` |
| `except` | Exception | Exception handler clause | `except e:` |
| `finally` | Exception | Always-execute block in try statement | `finally:` |
| `with` | Context | Context manager statement | `with open("file") as f:` |
| `as` | Binding | Import aliasing and exception binding | `import math as m` |
| `from` | Import | Selective import | `from math import pi` |
| `import` | Import | Module import | `import collections` |
| `in` | Membership | Membership test operator | `if x in list:` |
| `is` | Identity | Identity test operator | `if x is None:` |

Implemented but incomplete

| `async` | Concurrency | Asynchronous function declaration | `async fn fetch():` |
| `await` | Concurrency | Wait for async operation | `await fetch()` |
-->

## Mojo-specific keywords

| Keyword | Purpose | Example |
|---------|---------|---------|
| `fn` | Function declaration (non-raising by default) | `fn compute() -> Int:` |
| `def` | Function declaration (can raise) | `def process():` |
| `struct` | Structure type declaration | `struct Point:` |
| `trait` | Trait interface declaration | `trait Comparable:` |
| `comptime` | Compile-time evaluation | `comptime SIZE = 1024` |
| `var` | Variable/field declaration | `var x: Int` |
| `ref` | Reference argument convention | `fn modify(ref x: Int):` |

<!--

owned is now var.
__extension is not complete.

| `owned` | Owned argument convention | `fn take(owned value: String):` |
| `__extension` | Extension declaration for existing types | `__extension String:` |

-->

## Type introspection keywords

| Keyword | Purpose | Example |
|---------|---------|---------|
| `origin_of` | Returns origin (lifetime) of reference | `origin_of(x)` |
| `type_of` | Returns type of expression at compile time | `type_of(x)` |
| `conforms_to` | Tests trait conformance at compile time | `conforms_to(T, Trait)` |

## Literal keywords

| Keyword | Type | Value |
|---------|------|-------|
| `True` | Bool | Boolean true value |
| `False` | Bool | Boolean false value |
| `None` | NoneType | Absence of value |
| `Self` | Type reference | Reference to enclosing struct or trait type |
| `_` | Discard | Discard pattern in destructuring |

<!--
Excluded

## Compiler intrinsics

These keywords provide low-level access to compiler functionality:

| Keyword | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `__mlir_region` | Direct MLIR region embedding |
| `__get_address_as_uninit_lvalue` | Gets address of uninitialized storage |
| `__get_mvalue_as_litref` | Converts mutable value to literal reference |
| `__get_litref_as_mvalue` | Converts literal reference to mutable value |
| `__get_address_as_owned_value` | Gets address as owned value |
| `__functions_in_module` | Introspects functions in module |
| `__comptime_assert` | Compile-time assertion |

**Note:** Keywords with double-underscore prefix (`__`) indicate compiler internals and are subject to change.

## Escaped keywords

Use backticks to use keywords as identifiers:

```mojo
`fn` = 42          # Valid - escaped keyword as variable name
`struct` = "text"  # Valid - escaped keyword

obj.fn()           # Valid - keywords after dot don't need escaping
point.struct       # Valid - member access doesn't require escaping
```

## Case sensitivity

All Mojo keywords are case-sensitive:

```mojo
True               # Keyword - boolean literal
true               # Not a keyword - would be treated as identifier

None               # Keyword - None literal
none               # Not a keyword - would be treated as identifier

Self               # Keyword - type reference
self               # Not a keyword - conventional name for instance argument
```
