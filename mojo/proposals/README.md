# Mojo🔥 Engineering Design Proposals

This directory contains ad-hoc design proposals put together by the Mojo
engineering team. These are meant to help shape discussion and refine the
design of various subsystems, but typically become obsolete and incorporated
into more canonical documentation when the implementation work concludes.
There is no attempt to keep these up-to-date as the language evolves, so they
are more for historical reference than as a user-guide for the language.

> **Note for Mojo users:** For learning Mojo, please refer to the
> [official documentation](https://docs.modular.com/mojo/) instead. These
> proposals describe internal design discussions and may not reflect the
> current state of the language.

## Status Legend

- **Implemented**: The feature has been implemented in Mojo
- **Accepted**: The proposal has been accepted but not yet fully implemented
- **Proposed**: Still under discussion or awaiting approval
- **Draft**: Early-stage proposal, actively being developed
- **Partially Implemented**: Some aspects implemented, work ongoing
- **Abandoned**: No longer being pursued
