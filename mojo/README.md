# Mojo language ðŸ”¥

Mojo is a new programming language that bridges the gap between research
and production by combining Python syntax and ecosystem with systems
programming and metaprogramming features. Mojo is still young, but it is
designed to write blazing-fast code for CPUs, GPUs, and more as part of
the [Modular Platform](https://www.modular.com).

This directory includes:

- Mojo standard library: [/mojo/stdlib](stdlib)
- Mojo proposals: [/mojo/proposals](proposals)
- Mojo documentation: [/mojo/docs](docs)

To learn more about Mojo, see the
[Mojo Manual](https://docs.modular.com/mojo/manual/).

## Get started

You don't need to clone this repo to start programming with Mojo.

You can get Mojo by installing the `modular` package from `pip` or
`conda` (or with tools like `uv` and `pixi`).

If it's your first time, we recommend you follow our tutorial to
[get started with Mojo](https://docs.modular.com/mojo/manual/get-started).
