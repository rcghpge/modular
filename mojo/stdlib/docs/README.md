# Mojo standard library documentation

This documentation is for you if you're contributing to the Mojo standard
library. For example, if you're adding or changing stdlib APIs, fixing bugs, or
working through the codebase for the first time, start here.

## Table of contents

- [development.md](development.md)—**Mojo standard library development**: Set
up your environment, fork and branch, install the nightly Mojo compiler (for
example, with Pixi), and run tests. Start here if you're new to contributing.

- [style-guide.md](style-guide.md)—**Coding standards and style guide**:
  Conventions for stdlib code: file layout, `mojo format`, naming, value
  lifecycle, API docstrings, and how to validate docstrings.

  guide**: How to write API docs (docstrings) in Mojo: Markdown usage, code font,
  Parameters and Constraints sections, and alignment with the Google Python
  docstring style.

- [faq.md](faq.md)—**Frequently asked questions**: Contributor-focused FAQ for
  the standard library (platform support, bug reporting, `AnyType` vs
  `__TypeOfAllTypes`, MLIR dialects, compiler-runtime).
