# Test that C types have correct sizes on 32-bit targets (ILP32 data model).
# On 32-bit systems:
#   - c_long is 32-bit (4 bytes)
#   - c_long_long is 64-bit (8 bytes)
#
# Reference: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/64-bit_computing#64-bit_data_models

# Before this fix, compiling for 32-bit targets would fail with:
#   constraint failed: size of C `long` is unknown on this target
