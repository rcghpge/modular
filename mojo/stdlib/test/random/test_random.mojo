    This performs a simple chi-square-like test to verify that random_ui64

    Test methodology:
    - Generate 1000 samples from random_ui64(0, 9)

    - A broken RNG might produce values that cluster (e.g., mostly 0-3)
    - Or it might have bias toward certain values (e.g., even numbers)
    - Or it might produce predictable patterns (e.g., 0,1,2,3,0,1,2,3...)
