"""Implements layout-aware memory allocation and deallocation.

This module provides the `alloc` and `dealloc` functions together with a
`Layout` descriptor that expresses the size and alignment of an allocation at
the call site, keeping ownership and layout information explicit and
co-located.

Allocations are represented by two explicitly destroyed (`@explicit_destroy`)
owning handles, so the compiler forces every allocation to be released on all
paths — either by passing it to `dealloc` or by taking the raw pointer with
`unsafe_leak()`:

- `Allocation[T]`: the handle returned by `alloc`. It bundles the owning
  pointer with the `Layout` it was allocated with, so the element count and
  alignment needed to free the storage travel with the pointer.
- `ThinAllocation[T]`: a bare owning handle that carries only the pointer, with
  no `Layout`. It makes a good storage field for a container that already
  tracks its own capacity (such as `List`); pair it back with a `Layout` via
  `unsafe_with_layout` to deallocate.

Examples:

Allocate, use, and free storage through the `Allocation` returned by `alloc`:

```mojo
from std.memory.alloc import alloc, dealloc, Layout
from std.memory import destroy_n

var allocation = alloc(Layout[String](count=4))
var ptr = allocation.unsafe_ptr()

# initialize the memory
for i in range(allocation.layout().count()):
    (ptr + i).init_pointee_move("🔥")

# print the values
for string in allocation.unsafe_span():
    print(string) # prints "🔥"

# deinitialize the values
destroy_n(allocation.unsafe_ptr(), allocation.layout().count())

# deallocate the memory
dealloc(allocation^)
```

Drop the `Layout` with `into_thin` to keep only the bare `ThinAllocation` handle,
then re-attach a `Layout` with `unsafe_with_layout` to deallocate:

```mojo
from std.memory.alloc import alloc, dealloc, Layout

var layout = Layout[Int64].single()
var thin = alloc(layout).into_thin()
dealloc(thin^.unsafe_with_layout(layout))
```

Memory safety:

Because `Allocation` and `ThinAllocation` are `@explicit_destroy` types, the
compiler catches the three classic allocation bugs at compile time, instead of
leaving them as runtime hazards.

An accidental leak is rejected: the compiler requires every `Allocation` to be
destroyed on every path, including error paths. If an intervening operation can
raise, skipping the `dealloc`, that is an error (whose message includes the
guidance from `@explicit_destroy`):

```mojo
from std.memory import alloc, dealloc, Layout

def process() raises:
    var allocation = alloc(Layout[Int].single())
    might_raise()  # ERROR: 'allocation' abandoned without being explicitly destroyed: ...
    dealloc(allocation^)
```

A double-free is rejected: `dealloc` consumes the handle, so a second `dealloc`
is a use of an uninitialized value:

```mojo
from std.memory import alloc, dealloc, Layout

def main():
    var allocation = alloc(Layout[Int].single())
    dealloc(allocation^)
    dealloc(allocation^)  # ERROR: use of uninitialized value 'allocation'
```

A use-after-free is rejected: a pointer obtained from an `Allocation` borrows
from it, so it cannot be accessed once the handle has been consumed:

```mojo
from std.memory import alloc, dealloc, Layout

def main():
    var allocation = alloc(Layout[Int].single())
    var ptr = allocation.unsafe_ptr()
    dealloc(allocation^)
    print(ptr[])  # ERROR: potential indirect access to uninitialized value 'allocation'
```

    "An `Allocation` owns heap storage and must be consumed before it goes"

struct Allocation[T: AnyType](RegisterPassable, Writable):
    """An owning handle to a heap allocation of `T` together with its `Layout`.

    An `Allocation` pairs a `ThinAllocation` (the raw owning pointer) with the
    `Layout` that produced it, so the element count and alignment needed to
    deallocate the storage travel with the pointer. It is the value returned by
    `alloc`.

    `Allocation` is an explicitly destroyed (`@explicit_destroy`) type: it is
    never deallocated automatically, and the compiler requires every value to be
    destroyed manually on all paths. This prevents accidental leaks and
    double-frees. Destroy one by either:

    - passing it to `dealloc` to deallocate the storage,
    - calling `unsafe_leak()` to take ownership of the raw pointer (the caller
      then becomes responsible for manually deallocating it), or
    - calling `into_thin()` to drop the `Layout` and keep the owning
      `ThinAllocation`.

    Parameters:
        T: The type of the elements stored in the allocation.

    Example:

    ```mojo
    from std.memory.alloc import alloc, dealloc, Layout
