"""Runtime function compilation and introspection: assembly, IR, linkage, metadata.

The `compile` package exposes functionality for compiling individual Mojo
functions and examining their low-level implementation details. It enables
inspecting generated code, obtaining linkage information, and controlling
compilation options at runtime. This package provides tools for
metaprogramming, debugging, and understanding how Mojo code compiles.

This package is particularly useful for:

- Inspecting assembly, LLVM IR, or object code output
- Getting linkage names and module information
- Examining function metadata like captures
- Writing compilation output to files
- Controlling compilation options and targets

Example:
```mojo
from compile import compile_info

fn my_func():
    print("Hello")

# Get assembly for the function
info = compile_info[my_func]()
print(info.asm)
```
"""

from .compile import CompiledFunctionInfo, compile_info

# Re-export from reflection module for backwards compatibility
from reflection import get_linkage_name, get_type_name
