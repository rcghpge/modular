"""General utils: indexing, variants, static tuples, and thread synchronization.

The `utils` package provides foundational data structures and utilities used
throughout the Mojo standard library. It includes types for multi-dimensional
indexing, type-safe unions, fixed-size tuples, and thread synchronization
primitives. These tools solve common programming patterns that don't fit neatly
into other stdlib packages.

Use this package when you need low-level building blocks for data structures,
generic programming with sum types, or fine-grained control over threading and
indexing operations.
