"""Defines the Identifiable trait for identity-based comparisons.

This module provides the `Identifiable` trait, which enables types to support
identity comparison using the `is` and `is not` operators. Identity comparison
checks if two values refer to the same object, distinct from equality
comparison which checks if two values have the same content.
