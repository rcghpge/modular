"""GPU primitives package - warp, block, cluster, and grid-level operations.

This package provides low-level GPU execution primitives at various levels
of the GPU hierarchy:

- **warp**: Warp-level operations (shuffle, reduce, broadcast)
- **block**: Block-level operations (reductions across thread blocks)
- **cluster**: Cluster-level synchronization (SM90+)
- **grid_controls**: Grid dependency control (Hopper PDL)
- **id**: Thread/block/grid indexing and dimensions

These primitives form the foundation for GPU kernel development.
