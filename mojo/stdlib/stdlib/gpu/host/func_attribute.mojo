GPU Kernel Function Attributes Module

This module provides structures for defining and managing GPU kernel function attributes.
It implements functionality similar to CUDA's CUfunction_attribute enum, allowing
for querying and setting various attributes that control kernel execution behavior
and resource allocation.

The module includes:
- `Attribute`: A value type representing different GPU kernel function attribute types
- `FuncAttribute`: A structure that pairs an attribute type with its value

These structures enable fine-grained control over GPU kernel execution parameters
such as shared memory allocation, cache behavior, and cluster configuration.
