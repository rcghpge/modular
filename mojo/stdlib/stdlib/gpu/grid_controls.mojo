"""Grid Dependent Control primitives for NVIDIA Hopper (SM90+) GPUs.

This module provides low-level primitives for managing grid dependencies on NVIDIA
Hopper architecture and newer GPUs. It enables efficient orchestration of multi-grid
workloads by allowing grids to launch dependent grids and synchronize with them.

The module includes functions that map directly to CUDA grid dependency control
instructions, providing fine-grained control over grid execution order:

- `launch_dependent_grids()`: Triggers execution of grids that depend on the
  current grid
- `wait_on_dependent_grids()`: Blocks until all dependent grids complete execution

These primitives are essential for implementing complex GPU execution pipelines where
multiple kernels need to execute in a specific order with minimal overhead. They
eliminate the need for host-side synchronization when orchestrating dependent GPU work.
