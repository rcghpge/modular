"""The string package provides comprehensive Unicode string handling functionality for Mojo.

This package implements Unicode-aware string types and operations, with UTF-8 support.
It includes efficient implementations for string manipulation, formatting, and Unicode
operations while maintaining memory safety and performance.

Key Components:
- `String`: The main string type supporting UTF-8 encoded text,
- `StringSlice`: Memory-efficient string view type for zero-copy operations
- `Codepoint`: Unicode code point handling and operations
- Format: String formatting and interpolation utilities

Core Features:
- Unicode support with UTF-8 encoding
- Efficient string slicing and views
- String formatting and interpolation
- Memory-safe string operations
- Unicode case conversion
- Unicode property lookups and validation

Example:
```mojo
    # Basic string creation and manipulation
    var s = "Hello, 世界" # runtime type is `String`
    var slice = s[0:5] # "Hello"

    # Unicode-aware operations
    for c in s.codepoints():
        print(c.to_uppercase())

    # String formatting
    var name = "Mojo"
    var formatted = "Hello, {name}!"
```

Note:

String stores data using UTF-8, and all operations (unless clearly noted) are intended to
be fully Unicode compliant and maintain correct UTF-8 encoded data.
A handful of operations are known to not be Unicode / UTF-8 compliant yet, but will be
fixed as time permits.
