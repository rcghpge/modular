    """Asserts that the condition is true at run time.

    If the condition is false, the assertion displays the given message and
    causes the program to exit.

    You can pass in multiple arguments to generate a formatted
    message. No string allocation occurs unless the assertion is triggered.

    ```mojo
    x = 0
    debug_assert(x > 0, "expected x to be more than 0 but got: ", x)
    ```

    Normal assertions are off by default—they only run when the program is
    compiled with all assertions enabled. You can set the `assert_mode` to
    `safe` to create an assertion that's on by default:

    ```mojo
    debug_assert[assert_mode="safe"](
        x > 0, "expected x to be more than 0 but got: ", x
    )
    ```

    Use the `ASSERT` variable to turn assertions on or off when building or
    running a Mojo program:

    ```sh
    mojo -D ASSERT=all main.mojo
    ```

    The `ASSERT` variable takes the following values:

    - all: Turn on all assertions.
    - safe: Turn on "safe" assertions only. This is the default.
    - none: Turn off all assertions, for performance at the cost of safety.
    - warn: Turn on all assertions, but print any errors instead of exiting.

    To ensure that you have no run-time penalty from your assertions even when
    they're disabled, make sure there are no side effects in your message and
    condition expressions. For example:

    ```mojo
    person = "name: john, age: 50"
    name = "john"
    debug_assert("name: " + name in person, "unexpected name")
    ```

    This will have a run-time penalty due to allocating a `String` in the
    condition expression, even when assertions are disabled. To avoid this, put
    the condition inside a closure so it runs only when the assertion is turned
    on:

    ```mojo
    fn check_name() capturing -> Bool:
        return "name: " + name in person

    debug_assert[check_name]("unexpected name")
    ```

    If you need to allocate, and so don't want the assert to ever run on GPU,
    you can set it to CPU only:

    ```mojo
    debug_assert[check_name, cpu_only=True]("unexpected name")
    ```

    For compile-time assertions, see
    [`constrained()`](/mojo/stdlib/builtin/constrained/constrained).

        cond: The function to invoke to check if the assertion holds.
        assert_mode: Determines when the assert is turned on.
