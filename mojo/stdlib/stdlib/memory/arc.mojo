struct ArcPointer[T: Movable](Identifiable, ImplicitlyCopyable, Movable):
    """Atomic reference-counted pointer.

    This smart pointer owns an instance of `T` indirectly managed on the heap.
    This pointer is copyable, including across threads, maintaining a reference
    count to the underlying data.

    When you initialize an `ArcPointer` with a value, it allocates memory and
    moves the value into the allocated memory. Copying an instance of an
    `ArcPointer` increments the reference count. Destroying an instance
    decrements the reference count. When the reference count reaches zero,
    `ArcPointer` destroys the value and frees its memory.

    This pointer itself is thread-safe using atomic accesses to reference count
    the underlying data, but references returned to the underlying data are not
    thread-safe.

    Subscripting an `ArcPointer` (`ptr[]`) returns a mutable reference to the
    stored value. This is the only safe way to access the stored value. Other
    methods, such as using the `unsafe_ptr()` method to retrieve an unsafe
    pointer to the stored value, or accessing the private fields of an
    `ArcPointer`, are unsafe and may result in memory errors.

    For a comparison with other pointer types, see [Intro to
    pointers](/mojo/manual/pointers/) in the Mojo Manual.

    Examples:

    ```mojo
    from memory import ArcPointer
    var p = ArcPointer(4)
    var p2 = p
    p2[]=3
    print(3 == p[])
    ```

    Parameters:
        T: The type of the stored value.
    """
