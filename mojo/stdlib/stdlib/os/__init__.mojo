"""Provides access to operating-system dependent functionality.

The types and functions in this package primarily provide operating-system
independent access to operating-system dependent features, such as file systems
and environment variables.

For accessing files, see built-in [`open()`](/mojo/stdlib/builtin/file/open)
function and the [`file`](/mojo/stdlib/builtin/file/) module. For manipulating
file system paths, see the [`os.path`](/mojo/stdlib/os/path/) package for
OS-independent path manipulation functions and the `pathlib` package for
the [`Path`](/mojo/stdlib/pathlib/path/Path) struct, an abstraction for handling
paths.
