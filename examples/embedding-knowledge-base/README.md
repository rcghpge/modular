# Knowledge base with a text embedding model

A document management system that uses embeddings and clustering to organize and
search through documents semantically.

1. Start the embeddings endpoint:

    ```bash
    max serve --model sentence-transformers/all-mpnet-base-v2
    ```

1. Run the system:

    ```bash
    python -m embeddings.kb_system
    ```
