# When running in CI, graph tests can take around 300ms for a single run.
# These seem to be due to CI running under very high cpu usage.
# A similar effect can be achieved locally be running with each test multiple times `--runs_per_test=3`.
# They all launch at the same time leading to exceptionally heavy cpu usage.
# We have reasonable test suite timeouts. Use those instead of hypothesis deadlines.
