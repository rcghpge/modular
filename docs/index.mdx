## Modular Documentation

The Modular Platform accelerates AI inference and abstracts hardware
complexity. Using our Docker container, you can deploy a GenAI model from
Hugging Face with an OpenAI-compatible endpoint on a wide range of hardware.

And if you need to customize the model or tune a GPU kernel, Modular
provides a depth of model extensibility and GPU programmability that you
won't find anywhere else.
