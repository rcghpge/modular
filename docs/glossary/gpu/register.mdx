meta_title: What is a GPU register?
---

A GPU register is the fastest form of storage within a [streaming
multiprocessor](streaming-multiprocessor.mdx) (SM). Registers store integer and
floating point values used frequently by a [thread](thread.mdx), reducing
reliance on slower [memory](memory.mdx) types (shared, global, or local
memory).

Registers are located within an SM in what is referred to as a *register file*.
The number of registers depends on the GPU architecture, but modern GPUs support
thousands of registers per SM.

For each thread that it executes, the SM allocates a set of registers for the
private use of that thread. The registers are associated with that thread
throughout its lifetime, even if the thread is not currently executing on the
SM's cores (for example, if it is blocked waiting for data from memory). A
thread can't access registers assigned to a different thread, preventing data
conflicts between threads. If the execution of a [kernel](kernel.mdx) function
by a thread requires more registers than available, the compiler arranges to
spill some register data to the thread's local [memory](memory.mdx). Because
local memory access is slower than register access, programmers should try to
design their kernels to avoid or limit the amount of spill.
