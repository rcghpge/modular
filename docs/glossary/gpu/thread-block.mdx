meta_title: What is a GPU thread block?
---

In GPU programming, a thread block (also known as *workgroup* on AMD GPUs) is a
subset of threads within a [grid](grid.mdx), which is the top-level
organizational structure of the [threads](thread.mdx) executing a
[kernel](kernel.mdx) function. As the primary building block for workload
distribution, thread blocks serve multiple crucial purposes:

- First, they break down the overall workload — managed by the grid — of a
  kernel function into smaller, more manageable portions that can be processed
  independently. This division allows for better resource utilization and
  scheduling flexibility across multiple [streaming
  multiprocessors](streaming-multiprocessor.mdx) (SMs) in the GPU.

- Second, thread blocks provide a scope for threads to collaborate through
  shared memory and synchronization primitives, enabling efficient parallel
  algorithms and data sharing patterns.

- Finally, thread blocks help with scalability by allowing the same program to
  run efficiently across different GPU architectures, as the hardware can
  automatically distribute blocks based on available resources.

The programmer specifies the number of thread blocks in a grid and how they are
arranged across one, two, or three dimensions. Each block within the grid is
assigned a unique [block index](block-index.mdx) that determines its position
within the grid. Similarly, the programmer also specifies the number of threads
per thread block and how they are arranged across one, two, or three dimensions.
Each thread within a block is assigned a unique [thread index](thread-index.mdx)
that determines its position within the block.

The GPU assigns each thread block within the grid to a streaming multiprocessor
(SM) for execution. The SM groups the threads within a block into fixed-size
subsets called [warps](warp.mdx), consisting of either 32 or 64 threads each
depending on the particular GPU architecture. The SM's warp scheduler manages
the execution of warps on the SM's cores.

Threads within a block can share data through [shared memory](memory.mdx)
and synchronize using built-in mechanisms, but they cannot directly communicate
with threads in other blocks.
