meta_title: What is a GPU block index?
---

In GPU programming, a block index uniquely identifies a subset of
[threads](thread) that execute a [kernel](kernel.mdx) function on the GPU.
Threads are grouped into units called [blocks](thread-block.mdx), and multiple
blocks together form a larger structure known as a [grid](grid.mdx).

Each block within the grid is assigned a unique block index, which can be
represented across one, two, or three dimensions. This allows for flexible
organization of threads to match the structure of the problem being solved.
Within each block, individual threads have their own [thread
index](thread-index.mdx), which, together with the block index, determines which
part of the problem each thread should work on. This hierarchical structure of
grids, blocks, and threads enables efficient workload distribution across the
many processing cores of the GPU, maximizing parallel performance.

Because a programmer can arrange thread blocks within a grid across one, two,
or three dimensions, a block index is a 3-element vector of x, y, and z
coordinates. For 2-dimensional arrangements, the z coordinate of all block
indices is 0, and for 1-dimensional arrangements, both the y and z coordinates
of all block indices are 0.
