meta_title: What is GPU occupancy?
---

In GPU programming, occupancy is a measure of the efficiency of the GPU's
compute resources. It is defined as the ratio of the number of active
[warps](warp.mdx) to the maximum number of warps that can be active on a given
[streaming multiprocessor](streaming-multiprocessor.mdx) (SM) at any one time.

Higher occupancy can improve parallel execution and hide memory latency, but
increasing occupancy does not always boost performance, as factors like memory
bandwidth and instruction dependencies may create bottlenecks. The optimal
occupancy level depends on the workload and GPU architecture.
