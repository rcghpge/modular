meta_title: What is a GPU kernel?

A kernel is a function that runs on a GPU, executing computations in parallel
across a large number of [threads](thread.mdx). Kernels are a fundamental
part of general-purpose GPU (GPGPU) programming and are designed to process
large datasets efficiently by performing the same operation simultaneously on
multiple data elements.
