meta_title: What is a GPU thread index?
---

In GPU programming, a thread index uniquely identifies the position of a
[thread](thread.mdx) within a particular [thread block](thread-block.mdx)
executing a [kernel](kernel.mdx) function on the GPU. A thread block is a subset
of threads in a [grid](grid.mdx), which is the top-level organizational
structure of the threads executing a kernel function. Each block within the grid
is also assigned a unique block index, which identifies the block's position
within the grid. The combination of block index and thread index uniquely
identifies the thread's overall position within the grid, and is used to
determine which part of the problem each thread should work on.

Because a programmer can arrange threads within a thread block across one, two,
or three dimensions, a thread index is a 3-element vector of x, y, and z
coordinates. For 2-dimensional arrangements, the z coordinate of all thread
indices is 0, and for 1-dimensional arrangements, both the y and z coordinates
of all thread indices are 0.
