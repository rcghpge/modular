meta_title: What is a GPU grid?

A grid is the top-level organizational structure of the threads executing a
[kernel](kernel.mdx) function on a GPU. A grid consists of multiple [thread
blocks](thread-block.mdx) (also known as *workgroups* on AMD GPUs), which are
further divided into individual [threads](thread.mdx) (or *work units* on AMD
GPUs) that execute the kernel function concurrently.

The division of a grid into thread blocks serves multiple crucial purposes:

- First, it breaks down the overall workload—managed by the grid—into
  smaller, more manageable portions that can be processed independently. This
  division allows for better resource utilization and scheduling flexibility
  across multiple [streaming multiprocessors](streaming-multiprocessor.mdx)
  (SMs) in the GPU (or *compute units* on AMD GPUs).

- Second, thread blocks provide a scope for threads to collaborate through
  shared memory and synchronization primitives, enabling efficient parallel
  algorithms and data sharing patterns.

- Finally, thread blocks help with scalability by allowing the same program to
  run efficiently across different GPU architectures, as the hardware can
  automatically distribute blocks based on available resources.

The programmer specifies the number of thread blocks in a grid and how they are
arranged across one, two, or three dimensions. Typically, the programmer
determines the dimensions of the grid based on the dimensionality of the data to
process. For example, a programmer might choose a 1-dimensional grid for
processing large vectors, a 2-dimensional grid for processing matrices, and a
3-dimensional grid for processing the frames of a video. Each block within the
grid is assigned a unique [block index](block-index.mdx) that determines its
position within the grid.

Similarly, the programmer also specifies the number of threads per thread block
and how they are arranged across one, two, or three dimensions. Each thread
within a block is assigned a unique [thread index](thread-index.mdx) that
determines its position within the block. The combination of block index and
thread index uniquely identify the position of a thread within the overall grid.
