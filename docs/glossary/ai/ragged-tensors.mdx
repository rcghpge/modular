meta_title: What are ragged tensors?
---

Ragged tensors is a method for batching multiple requests with differing
sequence lengths without the need for [padding tokens](padding-tokens.mdx).
Ragged tensors allow sequences of variable lengths to be processed together
efficiently by storing them in a compact, non-uniform format.

Also sometimes referred to as "packed tensors."
