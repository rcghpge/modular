meta_title: What is an attention mask?
---

An attention mask is a mechanism used in the [attention](attention.mdx) layers
of a [transformer](transformer.mdx) model to indicate which tokens the model
should ignore when computing attention scores.

For example, attention masks can prevent the model from attending to [padding
tokens](padding-tokens.mdx), which are added to make sequences in a batch the
same length and thus offer no information for attention.

Another common mask is a "causal mask" (or "look-ahead mask"), which prevents
the [self-attention](self-attention) layer from looking at future tokens when
predicting a new token, ensuring that it attends only to previous tokens in the
sequence. Although it sounds absurd that it would even try to look at future
tokens (because it's generating tokens one at a time, in order), the
self-attention is designed for more general-purpose attention scoring. In its
most basic form, self-attention is agnostic to token order—it looks at all
tokens in the sequence equally, based on their embeddings, and calculates
scores by looking both backward and ahead in the sequence. (For example,
self-attention is used during [context encoding](context-encoding.mdx) to
establish an understanding of the input text.) So instead of creating a
different kind of attention mechanism for autoregressive inference, the causal
mask instructs the self-attention layer to simply ignore all future tokens and
only look backward when generating scores that help predict the next token.
