meta_title: What is continuous batching?
---

Continuous batching is a [batching](batching.mdx) technique that can
continuously dispatch inference requests to the GPU for [token
generation](token-generation.mdx) and dramatically improve GPU utilization.
Continuous batching can start executing a new batch even before the previous
batch finishes its pass through the model, because this batching technique
schedules new processing at the "token level."

That is, because large language models (LLMs) generate responses one token at a
time, there is a repeated cycle during inference (the token generation phase)
in which a new batch can jump in to utilize the GPU, even before a previous
batch finishes its pass through the model. That's what it means to operate at
the "token level"—the batch scheduler focuses on keeping the GPU busy with
token generation at all times, instead of waiting for the previous batch to
finish its complete forward pass.

This is sometimes called "in-flight batching" in cases where context
encoding and token generation requests are combined into the same batch.
