meta_title: What is prefill?
---

Prefill is the first phase of an AI model's forward pass in which the model
processes the input and initializes a cache to accelerate predictions.

Different model architectures may have their own version of a prefill, but it's
primarily associated with large language models (LLMs), in which case it's also
called [context encoding](context-encoding.mdx).
