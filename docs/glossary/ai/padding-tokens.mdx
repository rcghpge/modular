meta_title: What are padding tokens?
---

Padding tokens are extra tokens (usually zeros or special tokens) that are
added to the input for a model so that the input matches the model's fixed
input length or to ensure that all sequences in a [batch](batching.mdx) have
the same length.

In [transformer](transformer.mdx) models, padding tokens have been mostly
replaced with [ragged tensors](ragged-tensors.mdx).
