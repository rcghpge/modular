meta_title: What is autoregression?
---

Autoregression is a process by which an AI model iteratively predicts future
values based on previous values in a sequence, using its own output as input to
itself. Because each prediction depends on prior context, the process is
sequential, which limits parallelization.

Autoregression is a standard procedure in [transformer](transformer.mdx) models
such as large language models (LLMs) and other models that perform time-series
forecasting. This autoregressive process explains why AI chat bots like ChatGPT
and Gemini stream the output one word at a time—although they sometimes run so
fast that they appear to produce more than one word at a time.
