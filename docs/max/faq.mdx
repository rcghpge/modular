## Distribution

### What operating systems do you support? {#system-requirements}

You can install `modular` on Mac and Linux operating systems.

For more details, see the [system
requirements](/max/packages#system-requirements).

### What are the GPU requirements? {#gpu-requirements}

The Modular Platform supports both CPUs and GPUs, so you don't always need a
GPU to serve a model—although some larger models do require a GPU.

For details about GPU support, see our [list of compatible
GPUs](/max/packages/#gpu-compatibility).

### Will MAX be open-sourced?

We want to contribute a lot to open source, but we also want to do it right.
Our team has decades of experience building open-source projects, and we
believe it's very important to create an inclusive and vibrant
community, which takes a lot of work.

We've already begun open-sourcing parts of the MAX framework, including
our [Python serving library](https://github.com/modular/modular/tree/main/max/python/max/serve),
[MAX model architectures](https://github.com/modular/modular/tree/main/max/python/max/pipelines/architectures),
and [GPU kernels](https://github.com/modular/modular/tree/main/max/kernels/src/nn).

community](https://www.modular.com/community).

## Functionality

### What clouds and services can I deploy MAX onto?

You can deploy our MAX container across a variety of VM and Kubernetes-based
cloud services, including AWS, GCP, and Azure. To get started with any of them,
check out our [tutorials using MAX
Serve](/max/tutorials?filterByTags&tag=serve).

### Can I run MAX locally?

Yes. MAX has support for MacOS and ARM hardware, meaning it can be run on your
local laptop for exploration and testing purposes.

### Will MAX support distributed inference of large models?

Yes, it will support executing large models that do not fit into the memory of
a single device. This isn't available yet, so stay tuned!

## Installation

### Can I install both stable and nightly builds?

Yes, it's safe and easy to use the stable
and nightly builds for different projects, each with their own virtual
environment and package dependencies. For more information,
read the [packages guide](/max/packages).

### Does the MAX SDK collect telemetry?

Yes, the MAX SDK collects basic system information, session durations, compiler
events, and crash reports that enable us to identify, analyze, and prioritize
issues. The MAX container for model serving also collects performance metrics
such as time to first token and input processing time.

This telemetry is crucial to help us quickly identify problems and improve our
products for you. Without this telemetry, we would rely solely on
user-submitted bug reports, which are limited and would severely limit our
performance insights.

To disable serving telemetry, see the [MAX container
documentation](/max/container#metrics).
