Mojo is our not-so-secret weapon to achieve architecture-independent
performance for all types of AI workloads. In this tutorial, you'll learn
to write custom graph operations (ops) in Mojo that run on GPUs and CPUs,
and then load them into a MAX graph written in Python.

We'll start with a simple custom op that just adds `1` to every element in the
graph's input tensor, using an API that abstracts-away the CPU and GPU device
management. Then you'll learn to write specialized functions for CPUs and GPUs.
(GPU functions that run in parallel are also known as _kernels_.)

Before you begin, you should have a basic understanding of MAX graphs, which are
computation graphs written in Python. These graphs are the foundation for
high-performance AI models that run on MAX. To learn more, see our tutorial to
[get started with MAX graphs in
Python](/max/develop/get-started-with-max-graph-in-python). It also helps if
you know the [Mojo language basics](/mojo/manual/basics).

## Requirements

<Requirements requirementsData={requirementsWithGPU}
url="/max/packages#system-requirements" />

Although these examples work on both CPUs and GPUs, in order for the GPU code
paths to run, your system must meet the [GPU
requirements](/max/faq/#gpu-requirements).

## Get the examples

This tutorial is a walkthrough of a couple code examples from [our GitHub
repo](https://github.com/modular/modular). Start by cloning and running one of
the examples:

1. Clone the repo:

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/modular/modular.git
    ```

2. To ensure you have a compatible developer environment, we recommend using
[`pixi`](https://pixi.sh/latest/) to create a virtual environment and manage
the package dependencies. If you don't have it, install it:

    ```sh
    curl -fsSL https://pixi.sh/install.sh | sh
    ```

    Then restart your terminal for the changes to take effect.

3. Make sure everything works by running the first example:

    ```sh
    cd modular/examples/custom_ops

    pixi run python addition.py
    ```

    The exact output will vary based on random initialization of the input
    tensor, but the "Graph result" and "Expected result" should match:

    ```output
    Graph result:
      [[1.7736697 1.4688652 1.7971799 1.4553597 1.8967733 1.3691401 1.1297637
      1.7047229 1.1314526 1.3924606]
        # ... shorten for brevity
    Expected result:
      [[1.7736697 1.4688652 1.7971799 1.4553597 1.8967733 1.3691401 1.1297637
      1.7047229 1.1314526 1.3924606]
        # ... shorten for brevity
    ```

Now let's dive into the implementation details to understand how this custom
operation works under the hood.

## Example 1: Learn the custom op basics

To learn how to create a custom op, let's look as simple "hello world" example
that adds `1` to each element of a tensor—doing so in parallel on a GPU, if
available.

### Define the custom op in Mojo

Take a look at the custom op defined in
[`custom_ops/kernels/add_one.mojo`](https://github.com/modular/modular/tree/main/max/examples/custom_ops/kernels/add_one.mojo).
You'll see a Mojo [struct](/mojo/manual/structs) called `AddOne` with an
`execute()` function. Every custom op must be defined with this general format,
as described below.

Depending on the purpose of your custom op, the `execute()` function will accept
zero or more inputs and produce one or more outputs, as specified by the function
arguments.

Let's inspect the struct and function signatures:

```mojo title="kernels/add_one.mojo"
@compiler.register("add_one")
struct AddOne:
    @staticmethod
    fn execute[
        target: StaticString,
    ](
        output: OutputTensor,
        x: InputTensor[dtype = output.dtype, rank = output.rank],
        ctx: DeviceContextPtr,
    ) raises:
        # See below for the rest
```

The struct must include the
[`@compiler.register()`](/max/api/mojo-decorators/compiler-register) decorator,
which registers the custom op with MAX. The `add_one` name we set here is the
name we'll use to add the op to our Python graph in the next section.

The rest of the `execute()` signature describes the custom op's graph node to the
graph compiler: the parameters, inputs, and outputs:

- There's one [compile-time
parameter](/mojo/manual/parameters/#parameterized-functions), `target`, which
tells the function what kind of hardware it's being compiled for (either `"cpu"`
or `"gpu"`; we'll use this in the next example).

- The runtime arguments include the op's inputs and outputs, which take the form
of [`InputTensor`](/mojo/kernels/extensibility/tensor/managed_tensor_slice/#inputtensor)
and
[`OutputTensor`](/mojo/kernels/extensibility/tensor/managed_tensor_slice/#outputtensor),
respectively. These are specialized versions of the
[`ManagedTensorSlice`](/mojo/kernels/extensibility/tensor/managed_tensor_slice/ManagedTensorSlice)
type, which represents a tensor of a specific rank and datatype whose memory is
managed outside of the operation.

:::note

The `execute()` function must include `target` as the first parameter and
`output` as the first argument.

:::

Now let's look at the body of the `execute()` function, which is highlighted in
the following code. The op's core computation that adds `1` to each element in
the tensor happens in the `elementwise_add_one()` closure function.

```mojo title="kernels/add_one.mojo" {11-18}
@compiler.register("add_one")
struct AddOne:
    @staticmethod
    fn execute[
        target: StaticString,
    ](
        output: OutputTensor,
        x: InputTensor[dtype = output.dtype, rank = output.rank],
        ctx: DeviceContextPtr,
    ) raises:
        @parameter
        @always_inline
        fn elementwise_add_one[
            width: Int
        ](idx: IndexList[x.rank]) -> SIMD[x.dtype, width]:
            return x.load[width](idx) + 1

        foreach[elementwise_add_one, target=target](output, ctx)
```

We call `elementwise_add_one()` using
[`foreach()`](/mojo/kernels/extensibility/tensor/managed_tensor_slice/foreach/),
which
distributes an elementwise computation in parallel across all elements in the
output tensor. At compile time, `foreach()` optimizes the computation for the
hardware its running on, optimally distributing parallel workloads to make the
most efficient use of computational resources. This means that this same code
runs with optimal performance on CPU or GPU with no changes required.

Also notice that we pass the `target` parameter to the `foreach()` function,
which allows it to optimize for the hardware device. (We'll do this ourselves in
the [next example](#example-2-write-device-specific-kernels).)

### Add the custom op to a Python graph

Let's now look at the corresponding
[`custom_ops/addition.py`](https://github.com/modular/modular/tree/main/max/examples/custom_ops/addition.py)
file where we load the `add_one` custom op into a graph using
[`ops.custom()`](/max/api/python/graph/ops#max.graph.ops.custom).

Here's the code that specifies the path to the Mojo custom op and adds it to the
graph:

```python title="addition.py"
mojo_kernels = Path(__file__).parent / "kernels"

rows = 5
columns = 10
dtype = DType.float32
device = CPU() if accelerator_count() == 0 else Accelerator()

graph = Graph(
    "addition",
    forward=lambda x: ops.custom(
        name="add_one",
        device=DeviceRef.from_device(device),
        values=[x],
        out_types=[
            TensorType(
                dtype=x.dtype,
                shape=x.tensor.shape,
                device=DeviceRef.from_device(device),
            )
        ],
    )[0].tensor,
    input_types=[
        TensorType(
            dtype,
            shape=[rows, columns],
            device=DeviceRef.from_device(device),
        ),
    ],
    custom_extensions=[mojo_kernels],
)
```

:::note

Make sure the directory you pass to `custom_extensions` is a Mojo package
containing an `__init__.mojo` file (which can be empty).

:::

The [`Graph()`](/max/api/python/graph/Graph.md) takes an input tensor with five
rows and ten columns, runs the custom `add_one` operation on it, and returns the
result.

That's basically it. We created a custom op and added it to a graph!

Now we can run an inference, using
[`InferenceSession`](/max/api/python/engine#max.engine.InferenceSession). We
start by loading the graph onto the selected `device` (see above; either a CPU or
GPU "accelerator"):

```python title="addition.py"
session = InferenceSession(
    devices=[device],
)

model = session.load(graph)
```

Finally, we generate some random data and pass it as input:

```python title="addition.py"
# Fill an input matrix with random values.
x_values = np.random.uniform(size=(rows, columns)).astype(np.float32)

# Create a buffer and move it to the device (CPU or GPU).
x = Buffer.from_numpy(x_values).to(device)

# Run inference with the input tensor.
result = model.execute(x)[0]

# Copy values back to the CPU to be read.
assert isinstance(result, Buffer)
result = result.to(CPU())
```

Notice that the [`Buffer`](/max/api/python/driver#max.driver.Buffer) is initially
resident on the host (CPU), so we move it to the accelerator to be ready for use
with the graph on that device (if the device is the host CPU and not an
accelerator, the `to()` function is a no-op). Likewise, after we get results, we
move the result back to the CPU to read it.

As shown above, you can run this example as follows:

```sh
pixi run python addition.py
```

## Example 2: Write device-specific kernels

Now let's write some GPU code of our own.

The `add_one` custom op above uses
[`foreach()`](/mojo/kernels/extensibility/tensor/managed_tensor_slice/foreach/)
to run our
custom op computation. This function is a device-independent abstraction to
perform calculations on each element of a tensor, and it offers great
out-of-the-box performance for a range of CPUs and GPUs. However, there might
also be situations in which you want to write your own hardware-specific
algorithms.

So let's now look at the
[`vector_addition.mojo`](https://github.com/modular/modular/tree/main/max/examples/custom_ops/kernels/vector_addition.mojo)
custom op, which adds two vectors together in parallel on a GPU.

This example uses a programming model that may be familiar if you've used general
purpose GPU programming in CUDA or similar frameworks: We're going to write
separate functions for GPUs and CPUs, and the GPU function (kernel) is written
specifically for parallelism across GPU threads.

The vector addition op in `kernels/vector_addition.mojo` looks like this:

```mojo title="kernels/vector_addition.mojo"
@compiler.register("vector_addition")
struct VectorAddition:
    @staticmethod
    fn execute[
        target: StaticString,
    ](
        output: OutputTensor[rank=1],
        lhs: InputTensor[dtype = output.dtype, rank = output.rank],
        rhs: InputTensor[dtype = output.dtype, rank = output.rank],
        ctx: DeviceContextPtr,
    ) raises:
        @parameter
        if target == "cpu":
            _vector_addition_cpu(output, lhs, rhs, ctx)
        elif target == "gpu":
            _vector_addition_gpu(output, lhs, rhs, ctx)
        else:
            raise Error("No known target:", target)
```

Using the [parametric `if`](/mojo/manual/decorators/parameter), Mojo checks at
compile time if the target device has a GPU or not. If it does, it uses the
`_vector_addition_gpu()` function; otherwise, it uses `_vector_addition_cpu()`.
Compile-time specialization like this is a unique and powerful feature of Mojo
that makes it easy to optimize code for specific hardware.

The `_vector_addition_gpu()` function looks like this:

```mojo title="kernels/vector_addition.mojo"
fn _vector_addition_gpu(
    output: ManagedTensorSlice[mut=True],
    lhs: ManagedTensorSlice[dtype = output.dtype, rank = output.rank],
    rhs: ManagedTensorSlice[dtype = output.dtype, rank = output.rank],
    ctx: DeviceContextPtr,
) raises:
    alias BLOCK_SIZE = 16
    var gpu_ctx = ctx.get_device_context()
    var vector_length = output.dim_size(0)

    @parameter
    fn vector_addition_gpu_kernel(length: Int):
        var tid = block_dim.x * block_idx.x + thread_idx.x
        if tid < UInt(length):
            var idx = IndexList[output.rank](Int(tid))
            var result = lhs.load[1](idx) + rhs.load[1](idx)
            output.store[1](idx, result)

    var num_blocks = ceildiv(vector_length, BLOCK_SIZE)
    gpu_ctx.enqueue_function_experimental[vector_addition_gpu_kernel](
        vector_length, grid_dim=num_blocks, block_dim=BLOCK_SIZE
    )
```

The `vector_addition_gpu_kernel()` closure function runs once per thread on the
GPU, adding an element from the `lhs` vector to the matching element in the `rhs`
vector and then saving the result at the correct position in the `output` vector.
This function is then run across a grid of `BLOCK_SIZE` blocks of threads.

The block size is arbitrary here, and is not tuned for the specific GPU hardware
this will be run on. The previously-used `foreach()` abstraction will do
hardware-specific tuning for this style of dispatch, and is what we recommend for
simple elementwise calculations like this. However, this example shows how you
might mentally map CUDA C-style code to thread-level GPU operations in MAX.

You can execute this one in the same manner as the previous example, by running
the Python-based graph that uses the custom op:

```sh
pixi run python vector_addition.py
```

## Conclusion

Mojo is an incredible language for programming accelerators: Python-like
high-level syntax, systems language performance, and unique language features
designed for modern heterogeneous computation.

In the examples above, we've introduced the basics of how to write custom ops for
MAX graphs, place them in a one-operation graph in Python, and run them on an
available CPU or GPU. We showed how to use high-level abstractions like
[`foreach()`](/mojo/kernels/extensibility/tensor/managed_tensor_slice/foreach/)
to get great
performance on GPUs and CPUs, and also how to program GPU-specific functions to
control the parallelism yourself.
