description: Learn how to install Modular tools, set up your environment, and choose between nightly and stable versions

import InstallModular from '@site/docs/_includes/install-modular.mdx';
import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';
import Requirements from '@site/src/components/Requirements';
import { requirementsNoGPU } from '@site/docs/max/requirements';

All the Modular APIs and tools (including MAX and Mojo) are included in a
single Python/Conda package named `modular`. This page explains what's in the
package and shows how to install it.

If you just want to get started with Modular, instead see our
[quickstart guide](/max/get-started).

:::note

**New!** You can now install a standalone [`mojo` package](/mojo/manual/install).

## Package managers

You can install `modular` as a Python or Conda package. The install
instructions below include commands for popular package managers such as
`pixi`, `uv`, `pip`, and `conda`, but you can also use something else.

Traditional tools like `pip` and `conda` might be necessary for existing
production environments or Docker containers, but for your local development,
we recommend using [Pixi](https://pixi.sh/latest/).

Pixi is both a package manager and virtual environment manager, which alone
makes development a lot easier, but it's also language agnostic, extremely fast,
and includes lock files to easily reproduce your project environment.

You'll notice that our [GitHub code
examples](https://github.com/modular/modular/tree/main/max/examples) include a
`pixi.toml` file. This file configures the environment to make sure we all use
the same packages and get the same results—you just need to install `pixi`.

So if you're not set on using a particular package manager, we suggest you try
`pixi`. If you haven't used it before, check out our [Pixi basics guide](/pixi)
or the [official Pixi docs](https://pixi.sh/latest/).


## Install

To get the latest improvements and new features, we recommend
installing our nightly build, which we release several times a week. If you
want a better tested but older version, you can install a stable
build. (Each release is described in the [changelog](/max/changelog).)

System requirements:

<Requirements requirementsData={requirementsNoGPU}
url="/max/packages#system-requirements" />

:::tip

We recommend installing with `pixi` for the most reliable experience.

:::

<InstallModular folder="example-project" />

The `modular` package installs MAX, Mojo, and other package dependencies.

:::note GitHub stable branch

If you're using a stable build and want to clone the [Modular
repo](https://github.com/modular/modular), make sure you checkout the `stable`
branch (because the `main` branch includes the latest nightly code). For
example:

```sh
git clone -b stable https://github.com/modular/modular.git
```

## What's included

Here's a summary of what's in the `modular` package.

<Tabs groupId="install">
  <TabItem value="pixi" label="conda/pixi">

    The `modular` Conda package installs the following:

    - MAX tools and libraries:
      - [`max` CLI](/max/cli)
      - [`max` Python library](/max/api/python/)
      - [`max` Mojo library](/mojo/lib)
      - [MAX Engine C API](/max/api/c/)
    - The `mojo` package:
      - [`mojo` CLI](/mojo/cli) (includes the Mojo compiler)
      - [Mojo standard library](/mojo/lib)
      - Mojo language server (LSP) for IDE/editor integration
      - [Mojo debugger](/mojo/tools/debugging) (includes LLDB)
      - [Mojo code formatter](/mojo/cli/format)
      - [Mojo REPL](/mojo/cli/repl)

    `pixi` known issues:

    - You might encounter issues if you invoke `pixi` within a `conda` virtual
    environment. It's best if you don't mix the two tools.

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="pip" label="pip/uv">

    The `modular` Python wheel installs the following:

    - MAX tools and libraries:
      - [`max` CLI](/max/cli)
      - [`max` Python library](/max/api/python/)
      - [`max` Mojo library](/mojo/lib)
    - The `mojo` package:
      - [`mojo` CLI](/mojo/cli) (includes the Mojo compiler)
      - [Mojo standard library](/mojo/lib)
      - Mojo language server (LSP) for IDE/editor integration
      - [Mojo debugger](/mojo/tools/debugging) (includes LLDB)
      - [Mojo code formatter](/mojo/cli/format)
      - [Mojo REPL](/mojo/cli/repl)

guide](/mojo/manual/install).

## System requirements

To install `modular`, your system must meet these specifications.

<Tabs groupId="os">
<TabItem value="mac" label="Mac">

- macOS Sequoia (15) or later
- Apple silicon (M1 - M5 processor)
- Python 3.10 - 3.14
- Xcode or Xcode Command Line Tools 16 or later
- We have [limited compatibility](#gpu-compatibility) for Apple Silicon GPUs.
  You may need to run `xcodebuild -downloadComponent MetalToolchain`, which
  downloads the Metal utilities required for GPU programming in later versions
  of Xcode.

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="linux" label="Linux">

- Ubuntu 22.04 LTS
- x86-64 CPU (with [SSE4.2 or
  newer](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/articles/000057621/processors.html))
  or AWS Graviton2/3 CPU
- Minimum 8 GiB RAM (or much more, depending on the model you run)
- Python 3.10 - 3.14
- g++ or clang++ C++ compiler
- To use GPUs, see the [GPU compatibility](#gpu-compatibility)

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="windows" label="Windows">

Windows is not officially supported at this time.

In the meantime, you can try MAX on Windows [with
WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install), using a compatible
version of Ubuntu (see our requirements for Linux).

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### GPU compatibility

import GpuRequirements from '@site/docs/mojo/_includes/gpu-requirements.mdx';

The Modular Platform supports both CPUs and GPUs, so you don't always need a
GPU to serve a model or program with Mojo. But if you do want to accelerate
your model with GPUs or program for GPUs with Mojo, we support the following
GPUs.

<GpuRequirements />

:::note Notes

- Many GPUs are available in variants with different amounts of memory, and
each AI model has different memory requirements. So even if your GPU
architecture is listed as compatible, you must confirm that the available
memory is sufficient for the model you're using.

- Modular can serve lots of models on either CPU and GPU, but some models do
require one or more GPUs. When you browse our [model
repository](https://builds.modular.com/?category=models), you can filter by
models that support either CPU or GPU.
