    Owns a device (or host-pinned) memory allocation plus a strong
    ``ArcPointer`` to the parent ``Context``. The destructor frees
    via ``free_sync`` or ``free_host_pinned`` based on ``_is_pinned``,
    so the Mojo HAL's leak-unless-freed semantics never reach Python.

    Holding the context Arc — rather than relying on Python ref order —
    guarantees that if the user drops the ``Context`` before the
    ``Buffer``, ``free_*`` still has a valid context handle to call.
