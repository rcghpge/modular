# Neural network APIs

This is the source for our high-level [`max.nn` Python
API](https://docs.modular.com/max/api/python/nn/), used to build
performance-optimized MAX graphs such as those in the
[`pipelines/architectures/`](../pipelines/architectures/) directory.

If you're looking for the low-level compute kernels that correspond to these
Python APIs, see the [`max/kernels/`](../kernels) directory.
