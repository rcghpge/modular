    This class provides functionality for Pydantic-based config classes to load
    configuration from YAML files. Config classes should inherit from this class
    to enable config file support.

    Example:
        ```python
        from max.config import ConfigFileModel
        from pydantic import Field

        class MyConfig(ConfigFileModel):
            value: int = Field(default=1)

        config = MyConfig(config_file="config.yaml")
        ```

    # CLI arguments, quoted YAML strings) that rely on Pydantic's lax coercion
    # (e.g. "123" -> int, "1.5" -> float).  Override the strict=True default
    # inherited from MAXBaseModel so these conversions continue to work.

    as an "individual config" file).

    def load_config_file(cls, data: dict[str, Any]) -> dict[str, Any]:
        """Load configuration from YAML file if config_file is provided.

        This validator runs before Pydantic validation. Cyclopts processes config
        sources in order: CLI args are parsed first, then env vars (from Env config
        source) are applied. When this validator runs, `data` already contains CLI
        args and env vars merged together.

        To achieve the correct precedence (CLI > Config File > Env Vars > Defaults),
        we need to separate CLI args from env vars. However, since cyclopts merges
        them before validation, we approximate by:
        1. Loading config file values
        2. Merging with data (CLI args + env vars), where data takes precedence

        This results in: CLI args > Env vars > Config file > Defaults

        Note: The README documents the desired precedence, but due to cyclopts'
        architecture, config files cannot override env vars while still allowing
        CLI args to override everything. The actual precedence is:
        1. CLI arguments (highest)
        2. Environment variables
        3. Config files
        4. Defaults (lowest)

        Args:
            data: Dictionary of data to validate, may contain 'config_file' key.
                  This dict already contains CLI args and env vars merged by cyclopts.
        Returns:
            Dictionary with config file values merged in if config_file was provided.
