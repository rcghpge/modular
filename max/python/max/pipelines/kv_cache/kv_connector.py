    """Coerces a block hash to the canonical bytes form for connector calls.

    Block hashes flow through the prefix-caching layer as ``int | bytes``
    because each algo defines its own natural Python type at hash production
    (ahash64-family produces ``int``, SHA-256 produces ``bytes``). Below the
    ``KVConnector`` boundary every connector sees a single type. This shim
    is the only int->bytes coercion site and lives next to the Protocol it
    serves.

    Args:
        h: A block hash. ``int`` is encoded as 8 big-endian signed bytes,
            which covers the negative range produced by the ``sha256_64``
            truncation path. ``bytes`` must already be in canonical 8- or
            32-byte form and is returned unchanged.

    Returns:
        The 8-byte (ahash64-family) or 32-byte (SHA-256) canonical encoding.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If ``h`` is ``bytes`` with a length other than 8 or 32.

    The manager owns device tensors, block allocation, and device-side prefix
    cache. Connectors handle external tier operations (e.g., host memory)
    via load/offload methods.

    All block hashes crossing this Protocol are in canonical bytes form:
    8 big-endian bytes for ahash64-family algos (including ``sha256_64``),
    32 bytes for full SHA-256 digests. ``parent_seq_hash`` is ``None`` to
    denote the root of the chain; otherwise it is in the same bytes form
    as each element of ``block_hashes``. The ``BlockManager`` is
    responsible for any int->bytes coercion (see ``to_block_hash_bytes``);
    connectors never see Python ``int`` hashes.

    Required call ordering per inference step:
      1. connector.load()            # post loads on the main stream
      2. connector.wait_for_loads()  # block until loads have landed
