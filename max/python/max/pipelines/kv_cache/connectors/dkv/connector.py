"""Distributed KV cache connector via the dKV service.

A thin :class:`~max.pipelines.kv_cache.kv_connector.KVConnector` shim over the
``dkv_connector`` Rust client (``dkv_connector.DkvConnector``). The Rust client
owns the NIXL agent, all block transfers, the control-plane RPCs, inline
reconnection, and metrics; this shim only adapts the MAX-side types (device
``KVCacheMemory``, ``KVCacheMetrics``) to the client's API.

Block-hash contract: the dkv wire format carries a ``uint64 seq_hash`` and is
unchanged by this shim. Callers may pass either the 8-byte canonical encoding
used by ``ahash64`` / ``sha256_64`` or the 32-byte canonical encoding used by
full ``sha256``; in the 32-byte case the shim truncates to the first 8 bytes
at the boundary. Truncation is byte-identical to the existing ``sha256_64``
algorithm, so configuring MAX with ``sha256`` or ``sha256_64`` yields the
same dkv key for the same logical digest.
