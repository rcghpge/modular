"""Three-tier KV cache connector: GPU <-> CPU (pinned) <-> Disk.

Composes the CPU tier (pinned host ``Buffer`` + ``BlockOffloadEngine``) with a
``DiskTier`` that provides flat-file persistence. Write-through policy ensures
every block saved to CPU is also written to disk asynchronously, so CPU
eviction is always safe and disk coverage is maximised for warm restarts.
