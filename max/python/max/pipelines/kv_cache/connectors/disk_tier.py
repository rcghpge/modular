"""Disk-backed block storage for KV cache tiered offloading.

Provides a disk cache with async I/O and LRU eviction. Each block hash maps to
a single binary file containing all TP shards concatenated, stored under a
hex-named subdirectory keyed by the first byte of the hash so no single
directory grows unboundedly. Reads are prioritized over writes via a
priority-based thread pool.

    Writes are async, reads return a Future.
    LRU eviction keeps disk usage within a configurable budget.
    The cached set is the ``*.bin`` files themselves: a warm start rebuilds the
    in-memory index by scanning the shard subdirectories, so no metadata is
    persisted and the write path keeps no index in sync. A cache directory
    written by an older flat-layout build is treated as a cold start.

    ``block_nbytes`` is assumed constant for a given ``cache_dir``. Reusing a
    directory across a block-size change (page size, model, dtype, or TP degree)
    is unsupported: the stale, wrong-sized blocks are not detected and may be
    read as valid data. Point a changed configuration at a fresh ``cache_dir``.

    The `use_direct_io` flag controls whether the OS page cache is bypassed.
    This should be turned on for better performance if most local CPU memory is
    consumed (ie: for CPU KVCache). In other cases, leaving this off will yield
    better performance as reads and writes will be buffered by the OS page cache.
