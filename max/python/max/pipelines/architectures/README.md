# MAX model architectures

This directory contains the model architectures supported by MAX pipelines. Each
architecture defines how MAX reconstructs models from Hugging Face as
performance-optimized MAX graphs.

If you'd like to contribute a new model, read [Contributing custom model
architectures](/max/docs/contributing-models.md).
