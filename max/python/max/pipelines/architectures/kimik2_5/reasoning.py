    Per Moonshot's "Interleaved Thinking" design (see
    https://platform.moonshot.ai/docs/guide/use-kimi-k2-thinking-model and
    https://huggingface.co/moonshotai/Kimi-K2.5), a single assistant turn
    can interleave multiple ``<think>...</think>`` blocks with
    ``<|tool_calls_section_begin|>...<|tool_calls_section_end|>`` blocks.
    Only ``</think>`` ends a reasoning span; tool-call sections are
    neither reasoning nor content and are consumed by the tool parser
    (when the client opted in via ``tools=[...]``) or stripped from
    user-visible output otherwise.

    Reasoning may begin implicitly, without an explicit ``<think>``
    token, when the chat template prefilled the assistant turn already
    inside a thinking block.

    Reasoning can be disabled through the chat template by including a
    ``</think>`` token at the end of the prompt; this is detected by
    :meth:`is_prompt_in_reasoning`.
