    """Pick ``k`` distinct indices into ``weights`` with inclusion probability
    ``min(1, k * weights[i] / sum(weights))``.

    Algorithm (systematic PPS with iterated-cap handling):

    1. Lay items end-to-end on a number line of length ``W = sum(weights)``,
       item ``i`` occupying an interval of length ``weights[i]``.
    2. Place ``k`` equally-spaced ticks at ``u, u + W/k, ..., u + (k-1)*W/k``
       with a single shared offset ``u ~ Uniform(0, W/k)``. Each tick lands
       in exactly one item's interval; that item is selected.
    3. If any item has ``weights[i] >= W/k``, its interval is at least as wide
       as the tick spacing and would be hit by 2+ ticks (a duplicate).
       Pre-include such items, remove them from the pool, recompute the
       threshold over the residual weight and residual tick count, and
       repeat. Then run systematic PPS over the residual.

    Why this removes the depletion bias of ``rng.choice(replace=False, p=...)``:
    sequential PPSWOR (numpy's no-replacement weighted sampling) over-includes
    small items because once a heavy item is drawn the remaining weights
    renormalize. Systematic PPS, by contrast, gives ``pi_i = k*weights[i]/W``
    *exactly* for any uncapped item: its interval is shorter than the tick
    spacing, so at most one tick can land in it, with probability equal to
    the interval length divided by the spacing. Plugging in:
    ``E[mean] = (1/k) * sum_i weights[i] * pi_i = sum_i weights[i]^2 / W``
    = the size-biased mean. No depletion, no convergence rate — equality
    by construction.

    Caps still leak some bias because pre-included items contribute
    ``T_i * 1`` instead of the ideal ``T_i * (k * T_i / W)``. ``cap_count == 0``
    is the condition for analytically zero bias; callers should warn the user
    when caps occur.
