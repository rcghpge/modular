class ElementsAttr(Protocol):
    """
    This interface is used for attributes that contain the constant elements of
    a tensor or vector type. It allows for opaquely interacting with the
    elements of the underlying attribute, and most importantly allows for
    accessing the element values (including iteration) in any of the C++ data
    types supported by the underlying attribute.

    An attribute implementing this interface can expose the supported data types
    in two steps:

    * Define the set of iterable C++ data types:

    An attribute may define the set of iterable types by providing a definition
    of tuples `ContiguousIterableTypesT` and/or `NonContiguousIterableTypesT`.

    -  `ContiguousIterableTypesT` should contain types which can be iterated
       contiguously. A contiguous range is an array-like range, such as
       ArrayRef, where all of the elements are layed out sequentially in memory.

    -  `NonContiguousIterableTypesT` should contain types which can not be
       iterated contiguously. A non-contiguous range implies no contiguity,
       whose elements may even be materialized when indexing, such as the case
       for a mapped_range.

    As an example, consider an attribute that only contains i64 elements, with
    the elements being stored within an ArrayRef. This attribute could
    potentially define the iterable types as so:

    ```c++
    using ContiguousIterableTypesT = std::tuple<uint64_t>;
    using NonContiguousIterableTypesT = std::tuple<APInt, Attribute>;
    ```

    * Provide a `FailureOr<iterator> try_value_begin_impl(OverloadToken<T>) const`
      overload for each iterable type

    These overloads should return an iterator to the start of the range for the
    respective iterable type or fail if the type cannot be iterated. Consider
    the example i64 elements attribute described in the previous section. This
    attribute may define the value_begin_impl overloads like so:

    ```c++
    /// Provide begin iterators for the various iterable types.
    /// * uint64_t
    FailureOr<const uint64_t *>
    value_begin_impl(OverloadToken<uint64_t>) const {
      return getElements().begin();
    }
    /// * APInt
    auto value_begin_impl(OverloadToken<llvm::APInt>) const {
      auto it = llvm::map_range(getElements(), [=](uint64_t value) {
        return llvm::APInt(/*numBits=*/64, value);
      }).begin();
      return FailureOr<decltype(it)>(std::move(it));
    }
    /// * Attribute
    auto value_begin_impl(OverloadToken<mlir::Attribute>) const {
      mlir::Type elementType = getShapedType().getElementType();
      auto it = llvm::map_range(getElements(), [=](uint64_t value) {
        return mlir::IntegerAttr::get(elementType,
                                      llvm::APInt(/*numBits=*/64, value));
      }).begin();
      return FailureOr<decltype(it)>(std::move(it));
    }
    ```

    After the above, ElementsAttr will now be able to iterate over elements
    using each of the registered iterable data types:

    ```c++
    ElementsAttr attr = myI64ElementsAttr;

    // We can access value ranges for the data types via `getValues<T>`.
    for (uint64_t value : attr.getValues<uint64_t>())
      ...;
    for (llvm::APInt value : attr.getValues<llvm::APInt>())
      ...;
    for (mlir::IntegerAttr value : attr.getValues<mlir::IntegerAttr>())
      ...;

    // We can also access the value iterators directly.
    auto it = attr.value_begin<uint64_t>(), e = attr.value_end<uint64_t>();
    for (; it != e; ++it) {
      uint64_t value = *it;
      ...
    }
    ```

    ElementsAttr also supports failable access to iterators and ranges. This
    allows for safely checking if the attribute supports the data type, and can
    also allow for code to have fast paths for native data types.

    ```c++
    // Using `tryGetValues<T>`, we can also safely handle when the attribute
    // doesn't support the data type.
    if (auto range = attr.tryGetValues<uint64_t>()) {
      for (uint64_t value : *range)
        ...;
      return;
    }

    // We can also access the begin iterator safely, by using `try_value_begin`.
    if (auto safeIt = attr.try_value_begin<uint64_t>()) {
      auto it = *safeIt, e = attr.value_end<uint64_t>();
      for (; it != e; ++it) {
        uint64_t value = *it;
        ...
      }
      return;
    }
    ```

    as bytes.

    **Rationale:** Identifying accesses to global data is critical to
    enabling efficient multi-threaded compilation. Restricting global
    data access to occur through symbols and limiting the places that can
    legally hold a symbol reference simplifies reasoning about these data

    A strided layout attribute captures layout information of the memref type in
    the canonical form. Specifically, it contains a list of _strides_, one for
    each dimension. A stride is the number of elements in the linear storage
    one must step over to reflect an increment in the given dimension. For
    example, a `MxN` row-major contiguous shaped type would have the strides
    `[N, 1]`. The layout attribute also contains the _offset_ from the base
    pointer of the shaped type to the first effectively accessed element,
    expressed in terms of the number of contiguously stored elements.

    Strides must be positive and the offset must be non-negative. Both the
    strides and the offset may be _dynamic_, i.e. their value may not be known

    A `memref` type is a reference to a region of memory (similar to a buffer
    pointer, but more powerful). The buffer pointed to by a memref can be
    allocated, aliased and deallocated. A memref can be used to read and write
    data from/to the memory region which it references. Memref types use the
    same shape specifier as tensor types. Note that `memref<f32>`,
    `memref<0 x f32>`, `memref<1 x 0 x f32>`, and `memref<0 x 1 x f32>` are all
    different types.

    A `memref` is allowed to have an unknown rank (e.g. `memref<*xf32>`). The
    purpose of unranked memrefs is to allow external library functions to
    receive memref arguments of any rank without versioning the functions based
    on the rank. Other uses of this type are disallowed or will have undefined
    behavior.

    Are accepted as elements:

    - built-in integer types;
    - built-in index type;
    - built-in floating point types;
    - built-in vector types with elements of the above types;
    - another memref type;
    - any other type implementing `MemRefElementTypeInterface`.

    ##### Layout

    A memref may optionally have a layout that indicates how indices are
    transformed from the multi-dimensional form into a linear address. The
    layout must avoid internal aliasing, i.e., two distinct tuples of
    _in-bounds_ indices must be pointing to different elements in memory. The
    layout is an attribute that implements `MemRefLayoutAttrInterface`. The
    bulitin dialect offers two kinds of layouts: strided and affine map, each
    of which is available as an attribute. Other attributes may be used to
    represent the layout as long as they can be converted to a
    [semi-affine map](Affine.md/#semi-affine-maps) and implement the required
    interface. Users of memref are expected to fallback to the affine
    representation when handling unknown memref layouts. Multi-dimensional
    affine forms are interpreted in _row-major_ fashion.

    In absence of an explicit layout, a memref is considered to have a
    multi-dimensional identity affine map layout.  Identity layout maps do not
    contribute to the MemRef type identification and are discarded on
    construction. That is, a type with an explicit identity map is
    `memref<?x?xf32, (i,j)->(i,j)>` is strictly the same as the one without a
    layout, `memref<?x?xf32>`.

    ##### Affine Map Layout

    The layout may be represented directly as an affine map from the index space
    to the storage space. For example, the following figure shows an index map
    which maps a 2-dimensional index from a 2x2 index space to a 3x3 index
    space, using symbols `S0` and `S1` as offsets.

    ![Index Map Example](/includes/img/index-map.svg)

    Semi-affine maps are sufficiently flexible to represent a wide variety of
    dense storage layouts, including row- and column-major and tiled:

    ```mlir
    // MxN matrix stored in row major layout in memory:
    #layout_map_row_major = (i, j) -> (i, j)

    // MxN matrix stored in column major layout in memory:
    #layout_map_col_major = (i, j) -> (j, i)

    // MxN matrix stored in a 2-d blocked/tiled layout with 64x64 tiles.
    #layout_tiled = (i, j) -> (i floordiv 64, j floordiv 64, i mod 64, j mod 64)
    ```

    ##### Strided Layout

    Memref layout can be expressed using strides to encode the distance, in
    number of elements, in (linear) memory between successive entries along a
    particular dimension. For example, a row-major strided layout for
    `memref<2x3x4xf32>` is `strided<[12, 4, 1]>`, where the last dimension is
    contiguous as indicated by the unit stride and the remaining strides are
    products of the sizes of faster-variying dimensions. Strided layout can also
    express non-contiguity, e.g., `memref<2x3, strided<[6, 2]>>` only accesses
    even elements of the dense consecutive storage along the innermost
    dimension.

    The strided layout supports an optional _offset_ that indicates the
    distance, in the number of elements, between the beginning of the memref
    and the first accessed element. When omitted, the offset is considered to
    be zero. That is, `memref<2, strided<[2], offset: 0>>` and
    `memref<2, strided<[2]>>` are strictly the same type.

    Both offsets and strides may be _dynamic_, that is, unknown at compile time.
    This is represented by using a question mark (`?`) instead of the value in
    the textual form of the IR.

    The strided layout converts into the following canonical one-dimensional
    affine form through explicit linearization:

    ```mlir
    affine_map<(d0, ... dN)[offset, stride0, ... strideN] ->
                (offset + d0 * stride0 + ... dN * strideN)>
    ```

    Therefore, it is never subject to the implicit row-major layout
    interpretation.

    ##### Codegen of Unranked Memref

    Using unranked memref in codegen besides the case mentioned above is highly
    discouraged. Codegen is concerned with generating loop nests and specialized
    instructions for high-performance, unranked memref is concerned with hiding
    the rank and thus, the number of enclosing loops required to iterate over
    the data. However, if there is a need to code-gen unranked memref, one
    possible path is to cast into a static ranked type based on the dynamic
    rank. Another possible path is to emit a single while loop conditioned on a
    linear index and perform delinearization of the linear index to a dynamic
    array containing the (unranked) indices. While this is possible, it is
    expected to not be a good idea to perform this during codegen as the cost
    of the translations is expected to be prohibitive and optimizations at this
    level are not expected to be worthwhile. If expressiveness is the main
    concern, irrespective of performance, passing unranked memrefs to an
    external C++ library and implementing rank-agnostic logic there is expected
    to be significantly simpler.

    Unranked memrefs may provide expressiveness gains in the future and help
    bridge the gap with unranked tensors. Unranked memrefs will not be expected
    to be exposed to codegen but one may query the rank of an unranked memref
    (a special op will be needed for this purpose) and perform a switch and cast
    to a ranked memref as a prerequisite to codegen.

    Example:

    ```mlir
    // With static ranks, we need a function for each possible argument type
    %A = alloc() : memref<16x32xf32>
    %B = alloc() : memref<16x32x64xf32>
    call @helper_2D(%A) : (memref<16x32xf32>)->()
    call @helper_3D(%B) : (memref<16x32x64xf32>)->()

    // With unknown rank, the functions can be unified under one unranked type
    %A = alloc() : memref<16x32xf32>
    %B = alloc() : memref<16x32x64xf32>
    // Remove rank info
    %A_u = memref_cast %A : memref<16x32xf32> -> memref<*xf32>
    %B_u = memref_cast %B : memref<16x32x64xf32> -> memref<*xf32>
    // call same function with dynamic ranks
    call @helper(%A_u) : (memref<*xf32>)->()
    call @helper(%B_u) : (memref<*xf32>)->()
    ```

    The core syntax and representation of a layout specification is a
    [semi-affine map](Affine.md/#semi-affine-maps). Additionally,
    syntactic sugar is supported to make certain layout specifications more
    intuitive to read. For the moment, a `memref` supports parsing a strided
    form which is converted to a semi-affine map automatically.

    The memory space of a memref is specified by a target-specific attribute.
    It might be an integer value, string, dictionary or custom dialect attribute.
    The empty memory space (attribute is None) is target specific.

    The notionally dynamic value of a memref value includes the address of the
    buffer allocated, as well as the symbols referred to by the shape, layout
    map, and index maps.

    Examples of memref static type

    // A layout that yields a padding on two at either end of the minor dimension.
    #padded = affine_map<(d0, d1) -> (d0, (d1 + 2) floordiv 2, (d1 + 2) mod 2)>


    // The dimension list "16x32" defines the following 2D index space:
    //

    //
    memref<16x32xf32, #identity>

    // The dimension list "16x4x?" defines the following 3D index space:
    //

    //
    // where N is a symbol which represents the runtime value of the size of
    // the third dimension.
    //
    // %N here binds to the size of the third dimension.

    Values with tensor type represents aggregate N-dimensional data values, and
    have a known element type and a fixed rank with a list of dimensions. Each
    dimension may be a static non-negative decimal constant or be dynamically
    determined (indicated by `?`).

    The runtime representation of the MLIR tensor type is intentionally
    abstracted - you cannot control layout or get a pointer to the data. For
    low level buffer access, MLIR has a [`memref` type](#memreftype). This
    abstracted runtime representation holds both the tensor data values as well
    as information about the (potentially dynamic) shape of the tensor. The
    [`dim` operation](MemRef.md/#memrefdim-mlirmemrefdimop) returns the size of a
    dimension from a value of tensor type.

    The `encoding` attribute provides additional information on the tensor.
    An empty attribute denotes a straightforward tensor without any specific
    structure. But particular properties, like sparsity or other specific
    characteristics of the data of the tensor can be encoded through this
    attribute. The semantics are defined by a type and attribute interface
    and must be respected by all passes that operate on tensor types.
    TODO: provide this interface, and document it further.

    Note: hexadecimal integer literals are not allowed in tensor type
    declarations to avoid confusion between `0xf32` and `0 x f32`. Zero sizes
    are allowed in tensors and treated as other sizes, e.g.,
    `tensor<0 x 1 x i32>` and `tensor<1 x 0 x i32>` are different types. Since
    zero sizes are not allowed in some other types, such tensors should be
    optimized away before lowering tensors to vectors.
