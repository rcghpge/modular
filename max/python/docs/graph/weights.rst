Weights are the learned parameters that store a neural network's knowledge.
They're multi-dimensional arrays (tensors) of numerical values that determine how
the model transforms inputs into outputs. These weights contain all the
information needed for a model to perform its task - whether that's text
generation, image classification, or any other capability.
