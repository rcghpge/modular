class ProcessControl:
    """Manage signals between process & process creator

    Parent -> Process communication:
        - canceled: The creator politely signals to the process that it
          should finish its work and exit. It is expected that the process
          creator will use increasingly heavy handed tactics to stop the
          process if the process does not stop of its own accord.

    Process -> Parent communication:
        - heartbeat: Process emits a signal demonstrating it is still making
          progress.  This is the last timestamp at which the process work
          working correctly. All the usual advice around trusing clocks
          applies. Make sure that your health_fail_s is longer than heartbeat
          period.

        - started: Process has begun work

        - completed: Process has completed its work and has stopped.  This is
          intended to be used to support graceful shutdown.

    The basic pattern for the target of a process is as follows:

    def run(pc: process_control.ProcessControl):
        pc.set_started()
        while True:
            pc.beat()
            if pc.is_canceled():
                break
        pc.set_completed()

    In addition to the explicit signalling between parent & process, the
    process itself can be alive or dead. It is useful to list the possible
    combinations of signal and process-liveness:
        alive: Is the process running?
        started: Has user code signaled that it has started?
        completed: Has user code signaled that it is completed?
        N N N - initial state
        N N Y - should never happen
        N Y N - process started, but is now dead
        N Y Y - process started, completed, and is now dead
        Y N N - process started, but no user code signaled anything
        Y N Y - should never happen
        Y Y N - process is actively working
        Y Y Y - process has completed, is still alive, but *ought* exit soon

    Basic process monitoring can be accomplished by polling is_started() and
    is_canceled().  It can also be accomplished by waiting on started_event and
    canceled_event directly. `pc.started_event.wait()`
