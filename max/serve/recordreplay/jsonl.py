"""JSONL recording file format support.

In this format, recordings are stored with each recording item encoded as a
single line of JSON.  New lines separate recording items.  This matches the
common "JSON lines" or JSONL format.  See https://jsonlines.org for more
information.  Recording item schema is described by the schema module.
