"""Producer-consumer pipeline utilities for SM100 structured kernels.

This module provides pipeline synchronization primitives for warp-specialized
GPU kernels, enabling efficient producer-consumer patterns between warps.

Key abstraction:
- ProducerConsumerPipeline: Low-level barrier management for N-stage pipelines
- ProducerStage / ConsumerStage: Unified stage handles (linear types)

## Unified Stage Types

ProducerStage and ConsumerStage are linear types (`@explicit_destroy`) that work
in both contexts:

1. **Linear Type API** (flat, explicit):
    var stage = pipeline.acquire_producer()
    # ... use stage.index(), stage.mbar() ...
    stage^.release()  # Compiler enforces this call

2. **Context Manager API** (scoped, automatic):
    with pipeline.produce() as stage:
        # ... use stage.index(), stage.mbar() ...
    # release() called automatically

The context managers store the stage internally and return a `ref` to it,
allowing access to the full stage API while managing lifetime automatically.

## API Examples

Producer side (e.g., MMA warp producing to epilogue):

    # Context manager:
    with pipeline.produce() as stage:
        mma_op.mma(a, b, tmem_offset)
        mma_op.commit(stage.mbar())
    # __exit__ calls stage^.release() -> producer_step()

    # Linear type:
    var stage = pipeline.acquire_producer()
    mma_op.mma(a, b, tmem_offset)
    mma_op.commit(stage.mbar())
    stage^.release()

Consumer side (e.g., epilogue consuming from MMA):

    # Context manager:
    with pipeline.consume() as stage:
        process(stage.index())
    # __exit__ calls stage^.release() -> arrive + consumer_step()

    # Linear type:
    var stage = pipeline.acquire_consumer()
    process(stage.index())
    stage^.release()  # Signal + advance

    # Explicit signaling:
    var stage = pipeline.acquire_consumer()
    if lane_id() < CLUSTER_SIZE:
        stage.arrive()
    stage^.release_without_signal()  # Advance only

Direct API (for special cases):
    pipeline.wait_producer() / wait_consumer()
    pipeline.producer_step() / consumer_step()
    pipeline.producer_mbar(stage) / consumer_mbar(stage)
