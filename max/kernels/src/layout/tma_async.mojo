"""
Tensor Memory Accelerator (TMA) Asynchronous Operations Module

Provides high-performance abstractions for NVIDIA's Tensor Memory Accelerator (TMA),
enabling efficient asynchronous data movement between global and shared memory in GPU kernels.
It is designed for use with NVIDIA Hopper architecture and newer GPUs that support TMA instructions.

Key Components:
--------------
- `TMATensorTile`: Core struct that encapsulates a TMA descriptor for efficient data transfers
  between global and shared memory with various access patterns and optimizations.

- `SharedMemBarrier`: Synchronization primitive for coordinating asynchronous TMA operations,
  ensuring data transfers complete before dependent operations begin.

- `PipelineState`: Helper struct for managing multi-stage pipeline execution with circular
  buffer semantics, enabling efficient double or triple buffering techniques.

- `create_tma_tile`: Factory functions for creating optimized `TMATensorTile` instances with
  various configurations for different tensor shapes and memory access patterns.
