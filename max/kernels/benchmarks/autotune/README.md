# `kbench`: A benchmarking toolkit for Mojo kernels

This directory includes `kbench` and other related tools. `kbench` is a
Python-based toolkit that builds and executes Mojo kernel benchmarks across a
grid of parameter combinations. You can use `kbench` for benchmarking,
autotuning (finding optimal kernel parameters), and analyzing the performance
of Mojo kernels.

For detailed documentation, read [Benchmarking Mojo kernels with
`kbench`](/max/docs/kernel-benchmarking.md).
