    """Collective allreduce summation operation.

    This op is a collective op which takes in tensors from different devices and
    outputs tensors on different devices.
    In particular, this operation will gather the inputs across different
    devices and reduce them via a summation operation.
    The result is then broadcasted back to the same devices that the inputs
    came from.

    This version of the allreduce sum op uses device-to-device transfers and
    hence is expected to be much slower than the :obj:`ops.allreduce.sum` version.

    Args:
        inputs: The input tensors to reduce.
        signal_buffers: Device buffer values used for synchronization.

    Returns:
        An iterable outputs which all hold the reduction output.
