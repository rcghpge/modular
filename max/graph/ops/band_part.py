    """Masks out everything except a diagonal band of an input matrix.

    Copies a tensor setting everything outside the central diagonal band of the
    matrices to zero, where all but the last two axes are effectively batches,
    and the last two axes define sub matrices.

    Assumes the input has dimensions [I, J, ..., M, N], then the output tensor
    has the same shape as the input, and the values are given by

    .. code-block:: python

        out[i, j, ..., m, n] = in_band(m, n) * input[i, j,  ..., m, n].

    with the indicator function:

    .. code-block:: python

        in_band(m, n) = ((num_lower is None || (m - n) <= num_lower)) &&
                        (num_upper is None || (n - m) <= num_upper))

    Args:
        input: The input to mask out.
        num_lower: The number of diagonal bands to include below the central
            diagonal. If None, include the entire lower triangle.
        num_upper: The number of diagonal bands to include above the central
            diagonal. If None, include the entire upper triangle.
        exclude: If true, invert the selection of elements to mask. Elements
            in the band are set to zero.

    Returns:
        A symbolic tensor value with the configured selection masked out
        to 0 values, and the remaining values copied from the input tensor.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If the input tensor rank is less than 2, or if num_lower/num_upper
            are out of bounds for statically known dimensions.
