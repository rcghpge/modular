    Hann window function:

    .. math::

        H[n] = 1/2 [1 - cos(2 * pi * n / (N - 1))]

    where N is window_length.

    Args:
        window_length: The length of the window.
        device: The device to run the operation on.
        periodic: bool
            flag determines whether the returned window trims off the last
            duplicate value from the symmetric window and is ready to be used
            as a periodic window with functions like stft().
            hann_window(L, periodic=True) == hann_window(L + 1, periodic=False)[:-1])
        dtype: The desired data type of the output tensor.

    Returns:
        A 1-D tensor of size (window_length,) containing the window.
