    """Device-to-Device transfer operation.

    This op transfers the input tensor from its current device over to another. A device represents a
    computation unit, like CPU, GPU, etc. This op is useful for instance when working with
    accelerators, like GPU, where for instance one may need to move data from GPU to GPU, or
    from one GPU to CPU.

    Args:
        x: The input tensor to transfer.
        device: The device to transfer to.

    Returns:
        A tensor transferred to device specified.
