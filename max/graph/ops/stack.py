    Args:
        values: A list of symbolic tensor values. Each tensor must have the same
            dtype and rank, and must have the same dimension size for each
            dimension.
        axis: The axis to concatenate along. If negative, indexes relative
            to the end of the tensor shape *plus 1*. For instance,
            ``stack(vs, -1)`` will create and stack along a new axis as the
            last dimension, aad ``stack(vs, -2)`` will create and stack along a new
            dimension which is inserted immediately before the last dimension.

    Returns:
        A new symbolic tensor representing the result of the stack. It will
        have rank ``n+1`` where ``n`` is the rank of each input tensor. Its size
        on each dimension other than ``axis`` will be the same as each input tensors',
        with the new axis inserted. Along the new dimension it will have size
        ``len(values)``.
