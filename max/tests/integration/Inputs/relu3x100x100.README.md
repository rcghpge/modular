# TorchScript: `relu3x100x100`

Generated with the following code:

```python
import torch
from torch import nn


class MyReLUModel(nn.Module):
    def forward(self, x):
        return nn.functional.relu(x)


model = MyReLUModel()
traced = torch.jit.trace(model, torch.zeros(1, 3, 100, 100))
torch.jit.save(traced, "relu3x100x100.torchscript")
```
