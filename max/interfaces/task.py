"""
Pipeline Tasks Module.

This module defines the set of supported pipeline tasks for the MAX API, encapsulated
in the `PipelineTask` enumeration. Pipeline tasks represent the high-level operations
that can be performed by a pipeline, such as text generation, embeddings generation,
audio generation, and speech token generation.

Each task type is associated with a specific input/output contract and is used to
route requests to the appropriate pipeline implementation. The `PipelineTask` enum
is used throughout the MAX API to ensure type safety and consistency when specifying
or querying the type of task a pipeline supports.

Typical usage includes:
    - Registering supported architectures and pipelines for a given task.
    - Determining the output type for a pipeline task.
    - Routing inference requests to the correct pipeline based on the task.

Available tasks:
    - TEXT_GENERATION: Generate text sequences from input prompts.
    - EMBEDDINGS_GENERATION: Generate vector embeddings for input data.
    - AUDIO_GENERATION: Generate audio outputs from input data.
    - SPEECH_TOKEN_GENERATION: Generate speech tokens for speech-related tasks.

See the `PipelineTask` enum for further details on each task type.
