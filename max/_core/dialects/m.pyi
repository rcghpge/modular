    `dense_resources` attribute. Note that dense resources encode their
    alignment in their first four bytes using the little-endian convention,
    where as this attribute describes the alignment explicitly.

    The `#M.target` attribute represents a compilation target configuration. It

    The user can also specify the default index bit width being used. This is
    important for GPUs where the hardware can support different index bit widths
    for cross compilation.

    The microarchitecture and features may encode version numbers, such as
    'sm_80' for CUDA compute capability 8.0. When deciding if a runtime host
    supports a compile time microarchitecutre or feature it may be necessary
    to compare these versions numerically rather than textually.

    Features are encoded in the form of "+feature1,+feature2".

    Example:
    ```mlir
    #M.target<triple="x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu", arch="znver3",
